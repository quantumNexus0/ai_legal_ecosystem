## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v18.x or higher)
- **npm** (v9.x or higher)
- **Python** (v3.10 or higher) - for Backend API
- **pip** - Python package manager
- **XAMPP** (or MySQL Server) - for Database
- **Git**
- A code editor (we recommend **VS Code**)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**
   
   Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page.

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai_legal_ecosystem.git
   cd ai_legal_ecosystem
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   Navigate to the platform directory:
   ```bash
   cd client/platform
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**
   - Start **XAMPP Control Panel**.
   - Start the **Apache** and **MySQL** modules.
   - (Optional) Use `setup_mysql.py` in the backend folder to verify/reset DB:
     ```bash
     cd ../legal_intelligence_api
     python setup_mysql.py
     ```

5. **Set Up Backend API**
   Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
   
   Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # Bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```

   Start the API server:
   ```bash
   python -m app.main
   ```

## 🎨 Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript Style

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Follow **ESLint** rules configured in the project
- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Prefer **const** over **let**, avoid **var**
- Use **arrow functions** for callbacks
- Use **async/await** instead of promises chains

### React Component Guidelines

1. **Component Structure**
   ```typescript
   // Imports
   import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
   import { ComponentProps } from './types';
   
   // Interface/Type definitions
   interface MyComponentProps {
     title: string;
     onSubmit: (data: FormData) => void;
   }
   
   // Component
   export const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({ title, onSubmit }) => {
     // Hooks
     const [state, setState] = useState<string>('');
     
     // Event handlers
     const handleClick = () => {
       // handler logic
     };
     
     // Effects
     useEffect(() => {
       // effect logic
     }, []);
     
     // Render
     return (
       <div>
         {/* JSX */}
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

2. **Props Destructuring**
   ```typescript
   // Good ✅
   const Header: React.FC<HeaderProps> = ({ title, subtitle }) => {
     return <h1>{title}</h1>;
   };
   ```

3. **State Management**
   - Use `useState` for local component state
   - Use `useEffect` for side effects
   - Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
   - Lift state up only when necessary
