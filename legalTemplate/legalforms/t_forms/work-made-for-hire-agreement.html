<p>The parties wish to memorialize their understanding of how that intellectual property will be created and treated.</p>
<p>The parties therefore agree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1. MATERIALS; WORK-FOR-HIRE.</strong></p>
<p>The Publisher hereby commissions the Author to create the Materials for the Publisher, according to the specifications set forth in <strong>Exhibit A</strong>. The parties will consider those Materials "works made for hire" by and for the Publisher, as that term is defined in §101 of the Copyright Act of 1976.</p>
<p><strong>2. TERM AND TERMINATION.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a) Term.</strong> This agreement will become effective as described in section 21. Unless it is terminated earlier in accordance with subsection (b), this agreement will continue until the Materials have been satisfactorily completed and the Author has been paid in full for such Materials (the "<strong>Term</strong>").</li>
<li><strong>(b) Termination.</strong>&nbsp;This agreement may be terminated:
<ul>
<li><strong>(i)</strong> by either party on provision of <field-source type="break" title="How many days' notice must either party provide to terminate this agreement?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="text" fid="term_days" label="Days"></field-source> days' written notice to the other party, with or without cause;</li>
<li><strong>(ii)</strong> by either party for a material breach of any provision of this agreement by the other party, if the other party's material breach is not cured within <field-source type="break" title="And how many days after they're given notice about an issue does a party have to correct it before the other party can terminate the agreement?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="text" fid="days_to_correct" label="Days"></field-source> days of receipt of written notice of the breach;<section-dep secid="author_biz_ind" secval="business">&nbsp; or</section-dep></li>
<li><strong>(iii)</strong> by the Publisher at any time and without prior notice, if the Author is convicted of any crime or offense, fails or refuses to comply with the written policies or reasonable directives of the Publisher, or is guilty of serious misconduct in connection with performance under this agreement<section-dep secid="author_biz_ind" secval="business">.</section-dep><section-dep secid="author_biz_ind" secval="individual">; or</section-dep></li>
<li><section-dep secid="author_biz_ind" secval="individual"><strong>(iv)</strong>&nbsp;automatically, on the death of the Author.</section-dep></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>(c) Effect of Termination.</strong> After the termination of this agreement for any reason, the Publisher shall promptly pay the Author for services rendered before the effective date of the termination.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. DELIVERY.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a) Delivery Date.</strong>&nbsp;By <field-source type="break" title="What's ''author_name'''s deadline for delivering their work to ''pub_name''?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="datepicker" fid="delivery_deadline" label="Date"></field-source>, the Author shall deliver the Materials to the Publisher for publication, in form and content acceptable to the Publisher. The Author shall deliver the Materials <field-source type="break" title="How should they deliver their work?" label="For example, by email, through the mail, or by fax."></field-source><field-source type="text" fid="delivery_method" label="Description"></field-source>.</li>
<li><strong>(b) Form of Delivery.</strong>&nbsp;<field-source type="break" title="And in what form?" label="For example, if the work includes photographs, you might write something like, &quot;the author should deliver color slides suitable for reproduction.&quot; If it's written, it could be, &quot;the author should deliver the manuscript double-spaced and in Helvetica font.&quot;"></field-source><field-source type="text" fid="delivery_form" label="Description"></field-source>.</li>
<li><strong>(c) Supplemental Information.</strong>&nbsp;If submitting any photograph or artwork under this agreement, the Author shall simultaneously furnish to the Publisher background facts and identification of persons represented in those works sufficient to enable appropriate, accurate captions and accompanying text to be written. On the Publisher's reasonable request, the Author shall furnish to the Publisher written releases from all persons whose likenesses appear in the works. If the Materials contain any matter that is copyrighted by anyone else, the Author shall obtain and submit to the Publisher written permission for the Publisher to publish the copyrighted elements.</li>
<li><strong>(d) Verification of Materials.</strong>&nbsp;The Author shall verify all facts in the Materials that are textual and furnish the verification materials to the Publisher at the Publisher's request, although the Publisher shall have the right to check the Materials for accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>(e)&nbsp;Failure to Deliver.</strong>&nbsp;If the Author does not for any reason complete or deliver the Materials and related documentation within the time and the manner provided in this agreement (a "<strong>Material Insufficiency</strong>"), the Publisher may:
<ul>
<li><strong>(i)</strong>&nbsp;terminate this agreement, in which event the Publisher shall be released from any further obligations to the Author, including the obligation to pay the Author;</li>
<li><strong>(ii)</strong>&nbsp;maintain the rights granted by the Author to the Publisher under this agreement and reduce the Publisher's payment obligation to the Author to a reasonable fee, which will reflect a fair price taking into consideration the Material Insufficiency, in the Publisher's reasonable sole discretion, which shall be at least $10.00 (the "<strong>Adjusted Fee</strong>"); or</li>
<li><strong>(iii)</strong>&nbsp;specify a new date by which the Author shall complete and deliver the Materials and related documentation to the Publisher.&nbsp; If requested&nbsp;by the Publisher, the Author shall promptly make changes in the Materials at no additional charge to the Publisher.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. OWNERSHIP OF THE MATERIALS AND DERIVATIVE WORKS.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a) Work for Hire.</strong>&nbsp;The work to be supplied by the Author under this agreement will be deemed a "work made for hire" under U.S. copyright laws, and the Publisher deemed the sole author of the Materials and the owner of all interest and proceeds of every kind, whether now known or later devised (including all copyrights and extensions and renewals of copyrights) to the Materials, with the right to make all uses of the Materials throughout the universe and all changes in the Materials as the Publisher deems necessary or desirable. If and to the extent the Materials are not deemed "works made for hire," the Author hereby transfers to the Publisher all of its interest in the Materials, together with exclusively, irrevocably, and in perpetuity, and throughout the universe, all interest (including all rights of copyright) in the Materials, including the right to enforce its right in and to secure registrations, renewals, reissues, and extensions of those. The Publisher may transform, edit, alter, distort, modify, add to, subtract from, enhance, broadcast, telecast, duplicate, distribute, or otherwise exhibit the Materials worldwide in all forms of media and forms of exploitation, now known or later created including websites, film, television, radio, and print. The Author will have no right to approve any use of the Materials. No third party has or will have any right of approval over the use of the Materials or will be due any amounts from the use of Materials.</li>
<li><strong>(b) Sole Proprietor.</strong> The Publisher shall be the proprietor of the Materials and of all rights in the Material throughout the world including the copyright and all rights under copyright in those.</li>
<li><strong>(c) Right to Change.</strong>&nbsp;The Publisher may revise the Materials as it deems appropriate to prepare them for publication. The Publisher may publish or may not publish the Materials.</li>
