<li>(f) <strong>Other Benefits.</strong> The Contractor has no claim against the Company under this agreement or otherwise for vacation pay, sick leave, retirement benefits, social security, worker's compensation, health or disability benefits, unemployment insurance benefits, or employee benefits of any kind.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. NATURE OF RELATIONSHIP; INVENTIONS.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Independent Contractor Status.</strong>
<ul>
<li>(i) The relationship of the parties under this agreement is one of independent contractors, and no joint venture, partnership, agency, employer-employee, or similar relationship is created in or by this agreement. Neither party may assume or create obligations on the other party's behalf, and neither party may take any action that creates the appearance of such authority.</li>
<li>(ii) The Contractor has the sole right to control and direct the means, details, manner, and method by which the Services will be performed, and the right to perform the Services at any time, place, or location. The Contractor or the Contractor's staff shall perform the Services, and the Company is not required to hire, supervise, or pay any assistants to help the Contractor perform those Services. The Contractor shall provide insurance coverage for itself and its staff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(b) <strong>Inventions Retained and Licensed.</strong> Attached as <strong>Exhibit B</strong> to this agreement is a list of all intellectual property that the Contractor made before its agreement with the Company (the <strong>"Prior Inventions"</strong>) that belong to the Contractor, that relate to the Company's proposed business, products, or research and development, and that are not assigned to the Company under this agreement. If no list is attached, the Contractor represents that there are no Prior Inventions. If disclosure of a Prior Invention would cause the Contractor to violate an existing confidentiality agreement, the Contractor may not list the Prior Invention in <strong>Exhibit B</strong> but shall instead provide the name of the invention, a list of the party or parties to which it belongs, and an explanation of why full disclosure was not given. A space is provided in <strong>Exhibit B</strong> for this purpose. If in the course providing services to the Company the Contractor incorporates into a Company product, process, or machine a Prior Invention owned by the Contractor or in which the Contractor has an interest, the Company will be granted and have a nonexclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license to make, have made, modify, use, and sell that Prior Invention as part of or in connection with that product, process, or machine.</li>
<li>(c) <strong>Company Inventions.</strong> The Contractor has no right or interest in any work or product resulting from the Services the Contractor performs for the Company, or any of the documents, reports, or other materials the Contractor creates in connection with those Services (collectively, the <strong>"Company Inventions"</strong>), and has no right to or interest in any copyright to the Company Inventions. The Company Inventions have been specially commissioned or ordered by the Company as "works made-for-hire," as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act, and the Company is therefore the author and owner of all copyrights in the Company Inventions.</li>
<li>(d) <strong>Disclosure of Company Inventions.</strong> The Contractor shall promptly disclose in writing to the Company all Company Inventions that the Contractor has authored, made, conceived, or first actually reduced to practice, alone or jointly with others.</li>
<li>(e) <strong>Assignment of Company Inventions.</strong> If the Company Inventions or any parts of those are deemed not to have been works made-for-hire, the Contractor hereby assigns to the Company all interest the Contractor may have in the Company Inventions, including all copyrights, publishing rights, rights to use, reproduce, and otherwise exploit the Company Inventions in all formats or media and all channels, whether now known or created in the future.</li>
<li>(f) <strong>Patent and Copyright Registrations.</strong> The Contractor shall assist the Company or its designee, at the Company's expense, to secure the Company's rights in the Company Inventions and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights, or other intellectual property rights relating to the Company Inventions in all countries, including by disclosing to the Company all pertinent information and data with respect to those, by signing all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments, and other instruments that the Company deems necessary to apply for and obtain such rights and to assign and convey to the Company, its successors, assigns, and nominees the exclusive interest in the Company Inventions, and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights, or other intellectual property rights relating to those. When it is in the Contractor's power to do so, the Contractor shall sign or cause to be signed these instruments or papers after the termination or expiration of this agreement. If the Contractor provides assistance after the termination or expiration of this agreement at the Company's request, the Company shall pay the Contractor a reasonable rate for any time spent. If <section-dep secid="contractor_type" secval="individual">because of the Contractor's mental or physical incapacity or</section-dep> for any <section-dep secid="contractor_type" secval="individual">other</section-dep> reason the Company cannot secure a signature to apply for or pursue any application of any United States or foreign patents or copyright registrations covering Company Inventions or original works of authorship assigned to the Company, the Contractor hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as the Contractor's agents and attorneys in fact, to act for and on behalf of the Contractor to sign and file any those applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of patent or copyright registrations with the same legal force and effect as if they had been signed by the Contractor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. USE OF TRADEMARKS.</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor may use, reproduce, and distribute the Company's service marks, trademarks, and trade names (if any) (collectively, the "Company Marks") in connection with the performance of the Services. Any goodwill received from this use will accrue to the Company, which will remain the sole owner of the Company Marks. The Contractor may not engage in activities or commit acts, directly or indirectly, that may contest, dispute, or otherwise impair the Company's interest in the Company Marks. The Contractor may not cause diminishment of value of the Company Marks through any act or representation. The Contractor may not apply for, acquire, or claim any interest in any Company Marks, or others that may be confusingly similar to any of them, through advertising or otherwise. At the expiration or earlier termination of this agreement, the Contractor will have no further right to use the Company Marks, unless the Company provides written approval for each such use.</p>
<p><strong>6. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> During the Term, the Contractor may have access to or receive certain information of or about the Company that the Company designates as confidential or that, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure, ought to be treated as confidential by the Contractor (<strong>"Confidential Information"</strong>). Confidential Information includes information relating to the Company or its current or proposed business, financial statements, budgets and projections, customer identifying information, potential and intended customers, employers, products, computer programs, specifications, manuals, software, analyses, strategies, marketing plans, business plans, and other confidential information, provided orally, in writing, by drawings, or by any other media. The Contractor will treat the Confidential Information as confidential and will not disclose it to any third party or use it for any purpose but to fulfill its obligations in this agreement. In addition, the Contractor shall use due care and diligence to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.</li>
<li>(b) <strong>Exceptions.</strong> The obligations and restrictions in subsection (a) do not apply to that part of the Confidential Information:
<ul>
<li>(i) was or becomes publically available other than as a result of a disclosure by the Contractor in violation of this agreement;</li>
<li>(ii) was or becomes available to the Contractor on a nonconfidential basis before its disclosure to the Contractor by the Company, but only if:
<ul>
<li>A. the source of such information is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company or is</li>
<li>not otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to the Contractor by a contractual, legal,</li>
<li>fiduciary, or other obligation; and</li>
<li>B. the Contractor provides the Company with written notice of its prior possession either (I) before the</li>
<li>effective date of this agreement or (II) if the Contractor later becomes aware (through disclosure to the</li>
<li>Contractor) of any aspect of the Confidential Information as to which the Contractor had prior</li>
<li>possession, promptly on the Contractor so becoming aware;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(iii) is requested or legally compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil or criminal investigative demand, or similar processes), or is required by a regulatory body, to be disclosed. However, the Contractor shall:
<ul>
<li>A. provide the Company with prompt notice of these requests or requirements before making a</li>
<li>disclosure so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate</li>
<li>remedy; and</li>
<li>B. provide reasonable assistance to the Company in obtaining any protective order. If a protective</li>
<li>order or other remedy is not obtained or the Company grants a waiver under this agreement, the</li>
<li>Contractor may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that, in the</li>
<li>written opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company, the Contractor is legally compelled</li>
<li>or otherwise required to disclose. However, the Contractor shall make reasonable efforts to obtain</li>
<li>reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any part of the Confidential Information</li>
<li>disclosed in this way; or</li>
<li>C.&nbsp;was developed by the Contractor independently without breach of this agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(c) <strong>Remedy.</strong> Money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this section by the Contractor and, in addition to all other remedies, the Company may seek (and may be entitled to) as a result of such breach, specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy.</li>

All files, records, documents, blueprints, specifications, information, letters, notes, media lists, original artwork or creative work, notebooks, and similar items relating to the Company's business, whether prepared by the Contractor or by others, remain the Company's exclusive property.</p>
<p><strong>10. INDEMNIFICATION.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Of Company by Contractor.</strong> At all times after the effective date of this agreement, the Contractor shall indemnify the Company and its subcontractors, officers, members, managers, employees, owners, sublicensees, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, and assigns (collectively, the <strong>"Company Indemnitees"</strong>) from all damages, liabilities, expenses, claims, or judgments (including interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees, accounting fees, and expert witness fees) (collectively, the <strong>"Claims"</strong>) that any Company Indemnitee may incur and that arise from:
<ul>
<li>(i) the Contractor's negligence or willful misconduct arising from the Contractor's carrying out of its obligations under this agreement;</li>
<li>(ii) the Contractor's breach of any of its obligations or representations under this agreement; or</li>
<li>(iii) the Contractor's breach of its express representation that it is an independent contractor and in compliance with all applicable laws related to work as an independent contractor. If a regulatory body or court of competent jurisdiction finds that the Contractor is not an independent contractor or is not in compliance with applicable laws related to work as an independent contractor, based on the Contractor's own actions, the Contractor will assume full responsibility and liability for all taxes, assessments, and penalties imposed against the Contractor or the Company resulting from that contrary interpretation, including taxes, assessments, and penalties that would have been deducted from the Contractor's earnings if the Contractor had been on the Company's payroll and employed as a Company employee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(b) <strong>Of Contractor by Company.</strong> At all times after the effective date of this agreement, the Company shall indemnify the Contractor and its officers, members, managers, employees, agents, contractors, sublicensees, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, and assigns (collectively, the <strong>"Contractor Indemnitees"</strong>) from all Claims that the Contractor Indemnitees may incur arising from:
<ul>
<li>(i) the Company's operation of its business;</li>
<li>(ii) the Company's breach or alleged breach of, or its failure or alleged failure to perform under, any agreement to which it is a party; or</li>
<li>(iii) the Company's breach of any of its obligations or representations under this agreement. However, the Company is not obligated to indemnify the Contractor if any of these Claims result from the Contractor's own actions or inactions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>11. FORCE MAJEURE.</strong></p>
<p>A party will not be considered in breach of or in default because of, and will not be liable to the other party for, any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this agreement by reason of fire, earthquake, flood, explosion, strike, riot, war, terrorism, or similar event beyond that party's reasonable control (each a <strong>"Force Majeure Event"</strong>). However, if a Force Majeure Event occurs, the affected party shall, as soon as practicable:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) notify the other party of the Force Majeure Event and its impact on performance under this agreement; and</li>
<li>(b) use reasonable efforts to resolve any issues resulting from the Force Majeure Event and perform its obligations under this agreement.</li>

<p><strong>14. ASSIGNMENT AND DELEGATION.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>No Assignment.</strong> Neither party may assign any of its rights under this agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other party. All voluntary assignments of rights are limited by this subsection.</li>
<li>(b) <strong>No Delegation.</strong> Neither party may delegate any performance under this agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other party.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>16. SEVERABILITY.</strong></p>
<p>If any one or more of the provisions contained in this agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, that invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other provisions of this agreement, but this agreement will be construed as if those invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provisions had never been contained in it, unless the deletion of those provisions would result in such a material change so as to cause completion of the transactions contemplated by this agreement to be unreasonable.</p>
<p><strong>17. NOTICES.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Writing; Permitted Delivery Methods.</strong> Each party giving or making any notice, request, demand, or other communication required or permitted by this agreement shall give that notice in writing and use one of the following types of delivery, each of which is a writing for purposes of this agreement: personal delivery, mail (registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return-receipt requested), nationally recognized overnight courier (fees prepaid), or email.</li>

<p><strong>19. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement constitutes the final agreement of the parties. It is the complete and exclusive expression of the parties' agreement about the subject matter of this agreement.
