<p><strong>4. OTHER EMPLOYMENT.</strong></p>
<p>The Employee shall devote all of his or her time and attention solely to the Company's business and interest. During the Employment Period, the Employee may not engage, directly or indirectly, in any other business activity, regardless of whether it is pursued for gain or profit. Nothing in this section 4 limits the Employee's right to invest his or her money in real estate or in other companies if that investment does not oblige the Employee to assist in the operation of the affairs of those companies.</p>
<p><strong>5. EXPENSES.</strong></p>
<p>The Company shall reimburse the Employee for all business expenses incurred by the Employee in connection with his or her duties under this agreement in accordance with the Company's normal policies. The reimbursement of these expenses is subject to the Employee's provision to the Company of receipts, statements, and vouchers to the Company's satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>6. CONFIDENTIALITY.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a) Confidentiality.</strong> During the Employment Period, the Employee may have access to or receive certain information about the Company that the Company designates as confidential or that, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure, ought to be treated as confidential by the Employee ("<strong>Confidential Information</strong>"). Confidential Information includes information relating to the Company or its current or proposed business, financial statements, budgets and projections, customer identifying information, potential and intended customers, employers, products, computer programs, specifications, manuals, software, analyses, strategies, marketing plans, business plans, and other confidential information, provided orally, in writing, by drawings, or by any other media. The Employee will treat the Confidential Information as confidential and will not disclose it to any third party or use it for any purpose but to fulfill his or her obligations in this agreement. In addition, the Employee shall use due care and diligence to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of that information.</li>
<li><strong>(b) Exceptions.</strong> The obligations and restrictions in subsection (a) do not apply to that part of the Confidential Information:
<ul>
<li>(i) was or becomes publically available other than as a result of a disclosure by the Employee in violation of this agreement;</li>
<li>(ii) was or becomes available to the Employee on a nonconfidential basis before its disclosure to the Employee by the Company, but only if:
<ul>
<li>A. the source of that information is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company or</li>
<li>is not otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to the Employee by a contractual, legal,</li>
<li>fiduciary, or other obligation; and</li>
<li>B. the Employee provides the Company with written notice of his or her prior possession either (I)</li>
<li>before the effective date of this agreement or (II) if the Employee later becomes aware (through</li>
<li>disclosure to the Employee) of any aspect of the Confidential Information as to which the Employee</li>
<li>had prior possession, promptly on the Employee so becoming aware;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(iii) is requested or legally compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil or criminal investigative demand, or similar processes), or is required by a regulatory body, to be disclosed. However, the Employee shall:
<ul>
<li>A. provide the Company with prompt notice of these requests or requirements before making a</li>
<li>disclosure so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate</li>
<li>remedy; and</li>
<li>B. provide reasonable assistance to the Company in obtaining a protective order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a protective order or other remedy is not obtained or the Company grants a waiver under this agreement, the Employee may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that, in the written opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company, the Employee is legally compelled or otherwise required to disclose. However, the Employee shall make reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any part of the Confidential Information disclosed in this way; or</li>
<li>(iv) was developed by the Employee independently without breach of this agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>(c) Obligation to Maintain Confidentiality.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>(i)</strong> <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> At all times during his or her employment with the Company, the Employee shall hold in strictest confidence, and not use, except for the benefit of the Company, or to disclose to any person, firm, or corporation without the prior written authorization of the Company, any of the Company's Confidential Information. <field-source type="break" title="Do you want to put a time limit on the employee's confidentiality obligations?"></field-source><field-source type="radio" fid="employee_confidentiality_obligations_time_limit" label="N/A" options="Yes,No"></field-source></li>
<li><section-dep secid="employee_confidentiality_obligations_time_limit" secval="Yes"><strong>(ii)</strong> <strong>Term.</strong> The Employee shall maintain the confidentiality and security of the Confidential Information until the earlier of: (A) such time as all Confidential Information disclosed under this agreement becomes publicly known and is made generally available through no action or inaction of the Employee or (B) the&nbsp;<field-source type="dropdown" fid="confidentiality_duration" label="Ok, on which anniversary of the end of the agreement? This does not include trade secrets, which must be protected for as long as they qualify as trade secrets." options="first,second,third,fourth,fifth"></field-source> anniversary of the termination of the Employee's employment with the Company. However, to the extent that the Company has disclosed information to the Employee that constitutes a trade secret under law, the Employee shall protect that trade secret for as long as the information qualifies as a trade secret.</section-dep></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>(d)</strong> <strong>Remedy.</strong> Money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for a breach of this section by the Employee and, in addition to all other remedies, the Company may seek (and may be entitled to) as a result of that breach, specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. INVENTIONS.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a)</strong> <strong>Inventions Retained and Licensed.</strong> Attached as <strong>Exhibit A</strong> to this agreement is a list of all intellectual property that the Employee made before his or her employment with the Company (the <strong>"Prior Inventions"</strong>) that belong to the Employee, that relate to the Company's proposed business, products, or research and development, and that are not assigned to the Company under this agreement. If no list is attached, the Employee represents that there are no Prior Inventions. If disclosure of any Prior Invention would cause the Employee to violate a prior confidentiality agreement, the Employee will not list the Prior Invention in <strong>Exhibit A</strong> but will provide a name of the invention, a list of the party or parties it belongs to, and the explanation why full disclosure was not given. A space is provided in <strong>Exhibit A</strong> for this purpose. If in the course of employment with the Company, the Employee incorporates into a Company product, process, or machine a Prior Invention owned by the Employee or in which the Employee has an interest, the Company will be granted and have a nonexclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license to make, have made, modify, use, and sell that Prior Invention as part of or in connection with that product, process, or machine.</li>
<li><strong>(b)</strong> <strong>Assignment of Inventions.</strong> The Employee shall disclose promptly in writing to the Company all Intellectual Property that the Employee has authored, made, conceived, or first actually reduced to practice, alone or jointly with others:
<ul>
<li>(i) while the Employee is or was performing duties for the Company;</li>
<li>(ii) during the Employee's employment with the Company, if it relates to the Company's areas of business or investigations;</li>
<li>(iii) that results from or is suggested by any work that the Employee does for the Company or at the Company's request; or</li>
<li>(iv) that was aided by the Employee's use of the Company's equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information, whether or not during working hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This Employee-created intellectual property is referred to in this agreement as <strong>"Inventions."</strong></li>
<li>The Employee acknowledges that any Invention the Employee makes within the scope of and during his or her employment with the Company and that is protectable by copyright is a "work made for hire," as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act.</li>
<li><strong>(c)</strong> <strong>Maintenance of Records.</strong> The Employee shall keep and maintain adequate and current written records of all Inventions the Employee makes (solely or jointly with others) during the term of employment with the Company. The records may be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, and any other format specified by the Company. The records will be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times.</li>
<li><strong>(d) Patent and Copyright Registrations.</strong> The Employee shall help the Company or its designee, at the Company's expense, secure the Company's rights in the Inventions and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights, or other intellectual property rights relating to the Inventions in all countries, including by disclosing to the Company all pertinent information and data about any of those, by signing all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments, and all other instruments that the Company may deem necessary to apply for and obtain those rights and to assign and convey to the Company, its successors, assigns, and nominees the exclusive interest in those Inventions, and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights, or other intellectual property rights relating to those. When it is in the Employee's power to do so, his or her obligation to sign or cause to be signed any such instrument or papers will continue after the termination of this agreement. If because of the Employee's mental or physical incapacity or for any other reason the Company cannot secure a signature to apply for or pursue any application of any United States or foreign patents or copyright registrations covering Inventions or original works of authorship assigned to the Company as above, the Employee hereby irrevocably designates and appoints the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as the Employee's agents and attorneys in fact, to act for and on behalf of the Employee to sign and file those applications and do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of patent or copyright registrations on them with the same legal force and effect as if signed by the Employee.</li>
<li><field-source type="break" title="By how many days after employment ends must the employee return company property?" label="Over the course of employment, the employee may have been issued items such as a laptop, tablet, or information such as blueprints, documents, or other property that needs to be returned."></field-source></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. RETURN OF PROPERTY.</strong></p>
<p>Within <field-source type="text" fid="employee_property_return_days" label="Days"></field-source> days of the expiration or earlier termination of this agreement, the Employee shall return to the Company, retaining no copies or notes, all Company products, samples, models, property, and documents relating to the Company's business including reports, abstracts, lists, correspondence, information, computer files, computer disks, and other materials and copies of those materials obtained by the Employee during and in connection with his or her work with the Company. All files, records, documents, blueprints, specifications, information, letters, notes, media lists, original artwork or creative work, notebooks, and similar items relating to the Company's business, whether prepared by the Employee or by others, remain the Company's exclusive property.</p>
<p><strong>9. USE OF TRADEMARKS.</strong></p>
<p>The Company may use, reproduce, and distribute the Company's service marks, trademarks, and trade names (if any) (collectively, the <strong>"Company Marks"</strong>) in connection with his or her employment. Any goodwill received from this use will accrue to the Company, which will remain the sole owner of the Company Marks. The Employee may not engage in activities or commit acts, directly or indirectly, that may contest, dispute, or otherwise impair the Company's interest in the Company Marks. The Employee may not cause diminishment of value of the Company Marks through any act or representation. The Employee may not apply for, acquire, or claim an interest in any Company Marks, or others that may be confusingly similar to any of them, through advertising or otherwise. At the expiration or earlier termination of this agreement, the Employee will have no further right to use the Company Marks, unless the Company provides written approval for each use.<field-source type="break" title="Do you wish to include a nonsolicitation section to this agreement?" label="A nonsolicitation clause prevents an employee from luring clients or customers, or using company contact lists after leaving the company."></field-source>
