Just in case, how many days does either party have to correct a breach after being notified of it, before the other party can terminate?" label="Someone &quot;breaching&quot; an agreement means they have failed to do what they promised. A &quot;material breach&quot; is a major failure, like not paying required fees, and can render the agreement meaningless if not corrected."></field-source></li>
<li>(iii) by either party for a material breach of any provision of this agreement by the other party, if the other party's material breach is not cured within&nbsp;<field-source type="number" fid="breach_correction" label="Days"></field-source> days of receipt of written notice of the breach.</li>

<li>(ii) at the Seller's discretion, it may either sell to the Buyer or dispose of elsewhere Goods in the course of manufacture or manufactured and not yet delivered, or delivered and not yet paid for.

All rights and remedies are cumulative, and the election of one remedy shall not preclude another. Any termination shall be without prejudice to accrued rights. Specifically, a termination due to default of delivery or payment for the Goods required under this agreement will not in any way affect or terminate the rights and obligations of the parties that have accrued under this agreement before or after that default in delivery or payment. Notwithstanding the termination of this agreement, the obligations intended to survive termination will continue in full force and effect.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>(a) Choice of Law.</strong> The laws of the state of <field-source type="state" fid="law_state" label="N/A"></field-source> govern this agreement (without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles).</li>
<li><strong>(b) Choice of Forum.</strong> Both parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in <field-source type="break" title="Now, in the case of a lawsuit, which county and state would it be filed in?

</ul>
<p><strong>17. SEVERABILITY.</strong></p>
<p>If any one or more of the provisions contained in this agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, that invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other provisions of this agreement, but this agreement will be construed as if those invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provisions had never been contained in it, unless the deletion of those provisions would result in such a material change so as to cause completion of the transactions contemplated by this agreement to be unreasonable.</p>
<p><strong>18. NOTICES.</strong></p>
