<p>The Borrower is indebted to the Lender in the amount of <field-source type="currency" fid="loan_amount" label="$ Amount"></field-source> (the "<strong>Loan</strong>"). The Loan is evidenced by a promissory note effective on the same date as this agreement (the "<strong>Note</strong>"), a copy of which is attached as <strong>Exhibit A</strong>. The Note and this agreement are collectively referred to as the "<strong>Loan Documents</strong>."</p>
<p>To induce the Lender to provide Loan to the Borrower as evidenced by the Note, the Borrower has agreed to enter into this security agreement for the benefit of the Lender and to grant the Lender a security interest in the Secured Property (as defined below) to secure the prompt payment, performance, and discharge in full of the Borrower's obligations under the Note.</p>
<p>The parties therefore agree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1. GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST.</strong></p>
<p>The Borrower grants to the Lender a security interest in the Secured Property (as defined in section 2 below) to secure payment of the Loan.</p>
<p><strong>2. SECURED PROPERTY.</strong></p>
<p>The secured property consists of all of the Borrower's interest as of the effective date of this agreement in the following properties and rights, wherever located, whether now owned or existing or later acquired and arising (the "<strong>Secured Property</strong>"): <field-source type="break" title="What property will be used to secure the loan?" label="Describe the specific property being used to secure the loan. Be clear and specific as you can. Avoid vague terms such as, &quot;all of the debtor's personal property.&quot;"></field-source><field-source type="text" fid="secured_property" label="Description"></field-source>.</p>
<p><strong>3. INDEBTEDNESS.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement is made to secure payment when due of the Loan. The Loan includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) all obligations of the Borrower to the Lender under the Note;</li>
<li>(b) all amendments, renewals, or extensions of the above;</li>
<li>(c) all costs incurred by the Lender in establishing, determining, continuing, or defending the validity or priority of its security interest, or in pursuing its rights under this agreement or any other Loan Document or in connection with any proceeding involving the Lender as a result of any financial accommodation to the Borrower; and</li>
<li>(d) all other costs of collecting the Loan, including attorneys' fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Borrower shall reimburse the Lender for these expenses immediately on demand, and until paid all costs shall bear interest at the highest per year rate applicable to the Loan and permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>4. REAFFIRMATION OF LOAN.</strong></p>
<p>The Borrower hereby reaffirms its obligation for the full and punctual payment and performance of the Note and all other obligations of the Borrower under the Note.</p>
<p><strong>5. BORROWER'S OBLIGATIONS.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) The Borrower shall pay the Loan at the time and in the manner provided in the Note;</li>
<li>(b) The Borrower shall ensure that the Secured Property remains free of all security interests other than the rights of the Lender created by this agreement;</li>
<li>(c) The Borrower will defend the Lender's interest in the Secured Property against the claims of all other persons; and</li>
<li>(d) The Borrower may not transfer any Secured Property while this agreement is in effect without the prior written consent of the Lender, which consent may be withheld or given in the Lender's sole discretion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. RECORDING OF AGREEMENT.</strong></p>
<p>On the effective date of this agreement, the Borrower will record this agreement and any security instrument creating a security interest on the Secured Property as required by law to protect the security interest of the Lender on the Secured Property. The Borrower shall pay all filing fees and associated expenses incident to this recordation.</p>
<p><strong>7. EVENTS OF DEFAULT.</strong></p>
<p>The Borrower will be in default under this agreement if any of the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) A default in the payment of the Loan or any of the obligations contained in this agreement or in the Loan Documents;</li>
<li>(b) Any representation made to the Lender by the Borrower proving to have been false in any material respect when made;</li>
<li>(c) Loss, theft, substantial damage, or destruction, or any sale or encumbrance to which the Lender did not consent in writing, of the Secured Property, or the making of a levy, seizure, or attachment on that property; or</li>
<li>(d) An Event of Default, as defined in the Note.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. REMEDIES FOR EVENTS OF DEFAULT.</strong></p>
<p>If an Event of Default occurs, the Lender may declare the Loan immediately due. In addition, the Lender will have all of the remedies set forth below, and these remedies are cumulative, so that the Lender may exercise one or more of these remedies until the Loan is paid in full without right of reinstatement, disgorgement, or repayment by reason of a preference, other creditor action, or by operation of law:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) cause all or any portion of the Secured Property to be registered in its name or the name of its nominee, designee, or assignee;</li>
<li>(b) have the exclusive right to receive all distributions with respect to the Secured Property;</li>
<li>(c) dispose of the Secured Property, at private or public sale, without advertisement of the time or place of the sale (or any adjournment), free of any right of redemption by the Borrower (this right of redemption being expressly waived by the Borrower), at the price, in the manner, and to the purchaser (including the Lender) that the Lender determines in its sole discretion. The proceeds of this sale will be applied to the Loan and the sale expenses (and the Borrower will remain liable for any deficiencies); or</li>
<li>(d) all other rights and remedies arising under this agreement or applicable law.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>9. RESPONSIBILITY FOR SECURED PROPERTY.</strong></p>
<p>The Borrower assumes all responsibility for the Secured Property, and the Loan will not be affected by the loss, destruction, damage, or theft of any of the Secured Property or its unavailability for any reason. The Lender</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) has no duty (either before or after an Event of Default) to collect any amounts related to the Secured Property or to preserve any rights relating to the Secured Property, and</li>
<li>(b) has no obligation to clean up or otherwise prepare the Secured Property for sale.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Borrower remains obligated under each agreement included in the Secured Property. The exercise of the Lender of any rights under this agreement does not release the Borrower from its obligations under the agreements included in the Secured Property. The Lender has no liability under the agreements included in the Secured Property.</p>
<p><strong>10. TERMINATION.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement and all rights of the Lender under this agreement will terminate when the Lender is satisfied that the Loan and all other obligations of the Borrower under the Loan Documents are paid and performed in full without reinstatement, disgorgement, or repayment by reason of a preference, other credit or action, or operation of law.</p>
<p><strong>11. INCONSISTENCIES.</strong></p>
<p><field-source type="break" title="Now, which agreement do you want to be the &quot;deciding&quot; agreement?" label="When more than one agreement is signed, there's a risk the provisions of one may contradict the other. If there's conflict, this section lets you decide which agreement's terms will take control."></field-source>If any provision of this agreement is inconsistent with any provision in the Note, the provisions of <field-source type="radio" fid="deciding_agreement" label="N/A" options="This agreement, The promissory note"></field-source><section-dep secid="deciding_agreement" secval="This agreement">this agreement will control.</section-dep><section-dep secid="deciding_agreement" secval="The promissory note">the Note will control.</section-dep></p>
