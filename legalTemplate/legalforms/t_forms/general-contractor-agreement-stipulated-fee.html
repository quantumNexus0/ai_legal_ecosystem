<p><strong>7. REPRESENTATIONS.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) The parties each hereby represent as follows:
<ul>
<li>(i) The drawings and specifications attached to this agreement as <strong>Exhibit A</strong> are the final drawings and specifications of the Work, and form an integral part of this agreement. Neither party may add or otherwise vary additions said drawings and specifications without the prior written consent of the other party.</li>
<li>(ii) The Contractor may, in its discretion, engage licensed subcontractors to perform the Work. However, the Contractor must fully pay those subcontractors and, in all instances, will remain responsible for the completion of this agreement and the Work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(b) The Contractor hereby represents as follows:
<ul>
<li>(i) The Contractor warrants that it is adequately insured for injury to its employees and others incurring loss or injury as a result of the acts of the Contractor or its employees or subcontractors and shall provide the Owner with proper certificates of insurance. The Contractor acknowledges that it is solely responsible for providing insurance coverage for itself and its staff.</li>

<p>If the Contractor is injured while performing the Work, the Owner will be exempt from liability for those injuries to the fullest extent allowed by law.</p>
<p><strong>9. SURETY BOND.</strong></p>
<p><field-source type="break" title="What's the contractor's required surety bond amount?" label="A surety bond is essentially insurance for the property owner. It's the amount they can recover if the contractor doesn't complete the job."></field-source>Before starting the Work, the Contractor shall obtain a surety bond in the amount of <field-source type="currency" fid="surety_amount" label="$ Amount"></field-source>, which will cover its obligations under this agreement.</p>
<p><strong>10. INDEMNIFICATION.</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor shall indemnify the Owner against all damages, liabilities, costs, expenses, claims, or judgments, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements that any of them may suffer from or incur and that arise or result primarily from (a) any gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Contractor arising from or connected with Contractor's carrying out of its duties under this agreement, or (b) the Contractor's breach of any of its obligations, agreements, or duties under this agreement.</p>
<p><strong>11. WARRANTY.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a) Correction of Defective Work.</strong> The Contractor shall promptly correct any Work rejected as defective or as failing to conform to <strong>Exhibit A</strong>, whether observed before or after substantial completion and whether or not fabricated, installed, or completed, and shall correct any Work found to be defective or nonconforming within a period of time as may be prescribed by law. The Contractor shall correct these mistakes within a reasonable time after receiving the Owner's written instructions and at its own cost (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). However, the Contractor is not required to correct at its own cost any damage that occurred after completion of the Work, unless the parties agree that the damage occurred because of an injury that took place before the Work was completed.</li>
<li><strong>(b) Normal Wear and Tear Only.</strong> The Contractor shall only be responsible for damages sustained by the Owner under conditions of normal wear and tear, and shall under no circumstances be responsible for damages or losses caused by wear and tear, misuse, neglect, negligence, abuse, or accident, or because of or arising from any risk insured against in terms of the homeowner's insurance policies normally issued by a reputable insurance company for residential properties. The Contractor shall under no circumstances be liable for any consequential loss or damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>12. TERMINATION.</strong></p>
<p>This agreement may be terminated:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) By either party on provision of 30 days' written notice to the other party, with or without cause.</li>
<li>(b) By either party for a material breach of any provision of this agreement by the other party, if the other party's material breach is not cured within 30 days of receipt of written notice thereof.</li>
<li>(c) By the Owner, if the Contractor defaults or persistently fails or neglects to carry out the Work or fails to perform any provision of the agreement after 30 days' written notice to the Contractor. Without prejudice to any other remedy the Owner may have, the Owner may make good such deficiencies and may deduct the cost thereof from the payment due the Contractor or, at the Owner's option, may terminate the agreement and take possession of the site and of all materials and equipment.</li>
<li>(d) By the Owner at any time and without prior notice, if the Contractor is convicted of any crime or offense, fails or refuses to comply with the written policies or reasonable directives of the Owner, or is guilty of serious misconduct in connection with performance under this agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event of termination not the fault of the Contractor, the Company shall promptly pay the Contractor according to the terms of <strong>Exhibit A</strong> for services rendered before the effective date of the termination. The Contractor acknowledges and agrees that no other compensation, of any nature or type, shall be payable hereunder following the termination of this agreement.</p>
<p><strong>13. NATURE OF RELATIONSHIP.</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor is not an employee of the Owner; the Contractor is working in its capacity as an independent contractor. The Contractor shall indemnify the Owner for any claims, including (but not limited to) liability insurance, workers' compensation, and tax withholding for the Contractor's employees.</p>
<p><strong>14. NOTE ABOUT EXTRA WORK AND CHANGE ORDERS.</strong></p>
<p>All changes or deviations in the Work ordered by the Owner must be in writing as a change order, a form of which is attached as <strong>Exhibit C</strong>. The Contract Price and time of completion, if applicable, will be increased or decreased accordingly by the parties' agreement. Any claims that the Contract Price or time of completion should be increased based on changes or deviations in the Work must be presented to the Owner by the Contractor in writing. The Owner's written approval of such Contract Price or time of completion increase must be obtained by the Contractor before any change or deviation in the Work is started. The valuation of the Contract Price change will be assessed on the basis of the valuation of similar work included in this agreement.</p>
<p><strong>15. OWNERSHIP OF DRAWINGS AND OTHER ITEMS.</strong></p>
<p>All drawings, reports, designs, sketches, working drawings, shop drawings, documents, certificates, plans, specifications, estimates, memoranda, analyses, calculations, models and other tangible evidence of the Contractor's work product prepared in connection with the Work shall become and remain the sole property of the Owner. The Contractor may retain copies of its work product for its records, but may not use this work product (except in performing the Work) without the written consent of the Owner. Any devices (other than equipment or devices that constitute part of the Work) or methods now being used in the marketplace, and incorporated into the project, are not considered to be property of the Owner. Innovative construction methods or mechanical devices developed by the Contractor or its subcontractors and used in connection with the Work are not considered the property of the Owner unless those methods or devices were developed by the Owner or the Owner's separate contractors.</p>
<p><strong>16. TYPES OF MATERIALS.</strong></p>
<p>All materials used by the Contractor in performing the work will be new, in compliance with all applicable laws and codes, and covered by a manufacturer's warranty (if appropriate) except as agreed upon in a signed writing by the Owner.</p>
<p><strong>17. OWNERSHIP OF MATERIALS.</strong></p>
<p>Any materials that are unfixed and required to perform the Work and that are delivered to the Property under this agreement shall remain the property of the Contractor until they have been paid for by the Owner.</p>
<p><strong>18. MATERIALS IN SHORT SUPPLY.</strong></p>
<p>If any of the materials set out in <strong>Exhibit A</strong> are in short supply or are unavailable for an unreasonable amount of time, the Owner shall select alternative material of similar quality from alternative (and readily available) materials proposed by the Contractor. The responsibility for paying any difference in price between the original materials and the alternative materials shall lie with the Owner.</p>
<p><strong>19. GOVERNING LAW.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a) Choice of Law.</strong> <field-source type="break" title="Now, let's talk location. Which state's laws will be used to interpret this agreement if there is a dispute?" label="This should probably be where the property is located."></field-source>The laws of the state of <field-source type="state" fid="governing_law_state" label="N/A"></field-source> govern this agreement (without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles).</li>
<li><strong>(b) Choice of Forum.</strong> Both parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in <field-source type="break" title="What county and state would handle any potential lawsuit?" label="Again, this should probably be where the property is located."></field-source><field-source type="text" fid="governing_law_county" label="County"></field-source> County, <field-source type="state" fid="governing_law_county_state" label="N/A"></field-source>.</li>
<li><strong>(c) Attorneys' Fees.</strong> If either party employs attorneys to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this agreement, the losing party shall reimburse the prevailing party for its reasonable attorneys' fees.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>20. AMENDMENTS.</strong></p>
<p>No amendment to this agreement will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by both parties.</p>
<p><strong>21. ASSIGNMENT AND DELEGATION.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a) No Assignment.</strong> Neither party may assign any of its rights under this agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other party. All voluntary assignments of rights are limited by this subsection.</li>
<li><strong>(b) No Delegation.</strong> Neither party may delegate any performance under this agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other party.</li>
<li><strong>(c) Enforceability of an Assignment or Delegation.</strong> If a purported assignment or purported delegation is made in violation of this section, it is void.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>22. COUNTERPARTS; ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a) Counterparts.</strong> The parties may execute this agreement in any number of counterparts, each of which is an original but all of which constitute one and the same instrument.</li>
<li><strong>(b) Electronic Signatures.</strong> This agreement, agreements ancillary to this agreement, and related documents entered into in connection with this agreement are signed when a party's signature is delivered by facsimile, email, or other electronic medium. These signatures must be treated in all respects as having the same force and effect as original signatures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>23. SEVERABILITY.</strong></p>
<p>If any one or more of the provisions contained in this agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, that invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other provisions of this agreement, but this agreement will be construed as if those invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provisions had never been contained in it, unless the deletion of those provisions would result in such a material change so as to cause completion of the transactions contemplated by this agreement to be unreasonable.</p>
<p><strong>24.&nbsp;NOTICES.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a) Writing; Permitted Delivery Methods.</strong> Each party giving or making any notice, request, demand, or other communication required or permitted by this agreement shall give that notice in writing and use one of the following types of delivery, each of which is a writing for purposes of this agreement: personal delivery, mail (registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return-receipt requested), nationally recognized overnight courier (fees prepaid), facsimile, or email.</li>
