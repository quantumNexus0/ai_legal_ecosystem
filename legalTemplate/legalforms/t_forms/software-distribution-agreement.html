<p>The Provider has created and licenses the software program known as <field-source type="break" title="Got it. What is the name of the software being distributed?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="text" fid="software_name" label="Name"></field-source> (together with the printed or online instructions, manuals, screens, and diagrams pertaining to the software and provided by the Provider, the "<strong>Software</strong>").</p>
<p>The Distributor operates various websites, including <field-source type="break" title="Moving right along. What's the distributor's website?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="text" fid="website" label="URL"></field-source> (the "<strong>Site</strong>").</p>
<p>The Provider wants to sell the Software through the Site, with the Distributor's assistance.</p>
<p>The parties therefore agree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1. LICENSE; NO EXCLUSIVITY.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a) License.</strong> The Provider gives the Distributor a nonexclusive right and license to:
<ul>
<li>(i) market the Software to licensees or potential licensees;</li>
<li>(ii) buy Software licenses for distribution to licensees or potential licensees; and</li>
<li>(iii) distribute the Software and licenses to the Software to licensees or potential licensees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>(b) No Ownership; No Exclusivity.</strong> The Distributor acknowledges that:
<ul>
<li>(i)&nbsp; the Provider reserves all ownership rights in the Software;</li>
<li>(ii) the Distributor acquires no interest in the Software, except for the right to offer for sale or to sell the Software to third parties in accordance with the terms of this agreement; and</li>
<li>(iii) nothing contained in this agreement restricts the Provider's right to sell, license, or otherwise grant rights in the Software to third parties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. TERM AND TERMINATION.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a) Term.</strong> This agreement will become effective as described in section 23 and continue for an initial term of <field-source type="break" title="How many years will the initial term of the agreement last?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="initial_term" label="Years"></field-source> year(s) (the "<strong>Term</strong>"). Unless either party gives written notice to the other at least <field-source type="break" title="How many days before the term ends does one party have to tell the other they intend to terminate?" label="If one party doesn't tell the other they want to end the agreement, it will auto-renew."></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="termination_notice" label="Days"></field-source> days before the end of the Term, this agreement will renew automatically for an additional <field-source type="prefill" fid="initial_term" label="N/A"></field-source>-year term. This automatic extension will continue to apply at the end of each extended period until the agreement is terminated. <field-source type="break" title="Is there a maximum number of years this agreement can be effective?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="radio" fid="maximum_years" label="N/A" options="Yes,No"></field-source><section-dep secid="maximum_years" secval="yes">However, this agreement may not remain effective for more than <field-source type="number" fid="max_eff_years" label="Years" q="Ok, how many years?"></field-source> years.</section-dep></li>
<li><strong>(b) Termination.</strong> This agreement may be terminated:&nbsp;<field-source type="break" title="Now, if a party violates the agreement, how many days do they have to correct it before the other party can terminate the agreement?" label="N/A"></field-source>
<ul>
<li>(i) by either party, on provision of <field-source type="prefill" fid="termination_notice" label="N/A"></field-source> days' written notice before the end of a Term;</li>
<li>(ii) by either party for a material breach of any provision of this agreement by the other party, if the other party's material breach is not cured within <field-source type="number" fid="breach_correction" label="Days"></field-source> days of receipt of written notice of the breach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>(c) Effect of Termination.</strong> After the termination of this agreement for any reason, the Distributor shall:
<ul>
<li>(i) immediately stop all further publication, sale, and other use of the Software;</li>
<li>(ii) remove all Software from the Site; and</li>
<li>(iii) destroy or return to the Provider all hard or electronic copies of Software in its possession or control.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any accrued rights to payment and remedies for breach will survive the termination of this agreement and, if directed by the Distributor, the Provider shall fulfill any orders placed under this agreement before termination, even if the fulfillment occurs after the termination.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. DISTRIBUTION, MARKETING, AND SUPPORT.</strong></p>
<p>The Distributor shall offer for sale and sell the Software on the Site via software download. The Provider will make available to the Distributor a downloadable file and collateral material and content to allow the Distributor to offer for sale and sell the Software, including marketing and delivery of the Software to customers. For Software sold under this agreement, the Provider shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) deliver support in the same manner and to the same extent as it supports the Software sold internally or through other distributors;</li>
<li>(b) provide a limited royalty-free (other than as set forth in this agreement) license to the Distributor to access and print information, logos, terms, and conditions with respect to the sale and download of the Software by the Distributor's customers; and</li>
<li>(c) require customers who purchase the Software to agree to a standard terms of use "click-wrap" agreement that identifies the Provider as the seller of the Software and that requires the purchaser to hold harmless any third-party distributor (including the Distributor) from legal actions related to the Software and its operation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Distributor shall have the sole discretion to determine the manner of all marketing, offering, sale, payment, or download of the Software on the Site, if those efforts are consistent with this agreement.</p>
<p><strong>4. FEES.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) The Distributor shall charge a fee to the Software's licensees for the electronic transmission and delivery of the Software as set forth below.</li>
<li>(b) The Provider will receive a fee from the Distributor for providing the Software to the Distributor and permitting the licensing of the Software by the Distributor to its customers.</li>
<li>These fees shall be based on a per unit price generated by the sale of the Software by the Distributor. As of the effective date of this agreement (as set out in section 23), the retail price for the Software is <field-source type="break" title="What is the retail price of the software as of this agreement's effective date?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="currency" fid="retail_price" label="$ Amount"></field-source>.&nbsp;<field-source type="break" title="For certain monthly order volumes, ''distributor_name'' will pay ''provider_name'' set amounts. How much will ''distributor_name'' pay at each level?" label="N/A"></field-source></li>
<li>For monthly order volume of up to <field-source type="number" fid="number_sales" label="Number of sales"></field-source> successful sales, the Distributor shall pay the Provider <field-source type="currency" fid="add_payments" label="$ Amount"></field-source><field-source type="radio" fid="other_volume" label="Add another?" options="Yes,No"></field-source>. <section-dep secid="other_volume" secval="yes">For monthly order volume of <field-source type="number" fid="number_sales2" label="Number of sales"></field-source> and above, the Distributor shall pay the Provider <field-source type="currency" fid="add_payments2" label="$ Amount"></field-source>.</section-dep></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. PAYMENT OF FEES.</strong></p>
<p>Within <field-source type="break" title="Within how many days of the end of the month will ''distributor_name'' send ''provider_name'' a sales statement?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="sales_statement_days" label="Days"></field-source> days after the end of each month, the Distributor shall send the Provider a sales statement (the "<strong>Statement</strong>") and pay the Provider's fee for the Software sold on the Site, net of any amounts refunded as set forth below.

If there is a legal action that seeks remedy from the Distributor concerning the Provider's warranty, infringement of copyright, patent, trade secret, or other proprietary right in the Software, the Distributor shall immediately notify the Provider of that action.
