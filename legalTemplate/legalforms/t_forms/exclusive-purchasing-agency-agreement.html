The Purchasing Agent hereby accepts the appointment and agrees to procure the Merchandise on an exclusive basis.</li>
<li>(b) <strong>Services.</strong> The Purchasing Agent shall:

<li>(iii) enter into purchasing agreements with independent manufacturers and vendors with respect to Merchandise, but act only on the explicit instructions of the Company;</li>
<li>(iv) when requested, arrange for transportation or appropriate insurance coverage related to shipment and delivery of the Merchandise to the Company, although the Company shall pay those fees and for that coverage;</li>

<li>(xi) disclose any problems concerning suppliers (including Existing Suppliers, as defined in section 7(b)) to the Company; and</li>
<li>(xii) perform other services (including negotiations and payment) (A) reasonably related to any of the other obligations, or (B) agreed to in writing by the parties.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(c) <strong>The Company shall:</strong>
<ul>
<li>(i) work exclusively with the Purchasing Agent in procuring the Merchandise, and not with any other agent or representative;</li>
<li>(ii) provide the Purchasing Agent with current information about the Company's merchandise and purchasing needs and requirements;</li>
<li>(iii) review all submitted samples and contracts, and provide clear and complete instructions to the Purchasing Agent with respect to those; and</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>(c) <strong>Effect of Termination.</strong> After the termination of this agreement for any reason, the Company shall promptly pay the Purchasing Agent for services rendered before the effective date of the termination.

<p><strong>3. COMPENSATION.</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>(b) <strong>Timing of Payment.</strong> The Company shall pay the Purchasing Agent's Commissions within <field-source type="break" title="How many days after receiving the items the agent purchased must the company pay these commissions?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="commission_payout" label="Days"></field-source> days of the Company's receipt of the Merchandise.</li>
<li>(c) <strong>Defective Merchandise.</strong> The Company will not pay a Commission that would otherwise be due to the Purchasing Agent if it is found that defective Merchandise was shipped and that that shipment was made by reason of the Purchasing Agent's negligence.</li>
<li>(d) <strong>No Commissions in Certain Circumstances.</strong> No commission shall be payable to the Purchasing Agent under any of the following circumstances:

How many days should this be?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="commission_days_limit" label="Days"></field-source> days after the termination of this agreement; and</li>
<li>B. the purchase is the direct result of the Purchasing Agent's efforts before that termination.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><strong>5. NATURE OF RELATIONSHIP.</strong></p>
<p>The relationship of the parties under this agreement is one of independent contractors, and no joint venture, partnership, agency, employer-employee, or similar relationship is created in or by this agreement. Neither party may assume or create obligations on the other party's behalf, and neither party may take any action that creates the appearance of that authority.</p>
<p><strong>6. TERRITORY.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Agent Territory.</strong> During the Term of this agreement, the Purchasing Agent shall use its best efforts to purchase the Merchandise in the following geographical area (the "<strong>Territory</strong>"): <field-source type="break" title="What's ''agent_name'''s territory?" label="This is the area where the agent can make their purchases.

<li>(b) <strong>Territory Reallocation.</strong> The Company may modify or limit the Territory with&nbsp;<field-source type="break" title="How many days' notice does the company need to give the agent about changes to their territory?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="territory_change" label="Days"></field-source> days' written notice to the Purchasing Agent.</li>

These manufacturers, suppliers, and vendors are intended only to be examples of the nature and type of market from which the Company desires that the Merchandise be purchased, and should not be construed as a limitation on the contracts that can be made by the Purchasing Agent under this agreement in the Territory.</li>
<li>(b) <strong>Existing Suppliers.</strong> The Purchasing Agent acknowledges that the Company has existing relationships with those suppliers listed in <strong>Exhibit B</strong> (the "<strong>Existing Suppliers</strong>"), and that no compensation is payable for purchases made by the Purchasing Agent from the Existing Suppliers, unless otherwise agreed by the Company in writing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. TITLE TO MERCHANDISE.</strong></p>
<p>Title to all Merchandise purchased by the Purchasing Agent on behalf of the Company immediately vests in the Company.</p>
<p><strong>9. QUALITY OF MERCHANDISE.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Defective Product - Purchasing Agent.</strong> Once orders have been placed for the Merchandise, the Purchasing Agent shall visit the manufacturer to inspect the quality of the Merchandise shipped on the Company's behalf. If, after such inspection, the Purchasing Agent determines that the Merchandise does not conform in quality or specifications to that which was ordered, the Purchasing Agent shall immediately notify the Company and request instructions regarding disposition of the Merchandise.</li>
<li>(b) <strong>Defective Product - Company.</strong> If the Company finds that the Merchandise is defective, the Purchasing Agent shall assist the Company in arranging for the return of that Merchandise and shall also assist in the recovery of amounts due from the manufacturer or vendor as result of the defective Merchandise.</li>
<li>(c) <strong>No Warranty.</strong> The Purchasing Agent makes no representation about the Merchandise purchased under this agreement and the Purchasing Agent disclaims all warranties, including any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. The Company shall look solely to the manufacturer or vendor of the Merchandise for any associated warranties and the Purchasing Agent shall have no liability for the condition or fitness of any of the Merchandise purchased by the Company under this agreement.

Additionally, the Purchasing Agent shall not be responsible or liable for the unavailability of any Merchandise or the failure of any manufacturer or vendor to timely deliver any Merchandise.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10. USE OF TRADEMARKS.</strong></p>
<p>The Purchasing Agent may use, reproduce, and distribute the Company's service marks, trademarks, and trade names (if any) (collectively, the "<strong>Company Marks</strong>") in connection with the performance of this agreement. Any goodwill received from this use will accrue to the Company, which will remain the sole owner of the Company&nbsp;Marks. The Purchasing Agent may not engage in activities or commit acts, directly or indirectly, that may contest, dispute, or otherwise impair the Company's interest in the Company Marks. The Purchasing Agent may not cause diminishment of value of the Company Marks through any act or representation. The Purchasing Agent may not apply for, acquire, or claim any interest in any Company Marks, or others that may be confusingly similar to any of them, through advertising or otherwise. At the expiration or earlier termination of this agreement, the Purchasing Agent will have no further right to use the Company Marks, unless the Company provides written approval for each such use.</p>
<p><strong>11. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> During the Term, the Purchasing Agent may have access to or receive certain information of or about the Company that the Company designates as confidential or that, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure, ought to be treated as confidential by the Purchasing Agent ("<strong>Confidential Information</strong>"). Confidential Information includes information relating to the Company or its current or proposed business, financial statements, budgets and projections, customer identifying information, potential and intended customers, employers, products, computer programs, specifications, manuals, software, analyses, strategies, marketing plans, business plans, and other confidential information, provided orally, in writing, by drawings, or by any other media. The Purchasing Agent will treat the Confidential Information as confidential and will not disclose it to any third party or use it for any purpose but to fulfill its obligations in this agreement. In addition, the Purchasing Agent shall use due care and diligence to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.</li>
<li>(b) <strong>Exceptions.</strong> The obligations and restrictions in subsection (a) do not apply to that part of the Confidential Information:
<ul>
<li>(i) was or becomes publically available other than as a result of a disclosure by the Purchasing Agent in violation of this agreement;</li>
<li>(ii) was or becomes available to the Purchasing Agent on a nonconfidential basis before its disclosure to the Purchasing Agent by the Company, but only if:
<ul>
<li>A. the source of such information is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company or is not otherwise prohibited</li>
<li>from transmitting the information to the Purchasing Agent by a contractual, legal, fiduciary, or other obligation; and</li>
<li>B. the Purchasing Agent provides the Company with written notice of its prior possession either (1) before the effective date of</li>
<li>this agreement or (2) if the Purchasing Agent later becomes aware (through disclosure to the Purchasing Agent) of any aspect</li>
<li>of the Confidential Information as to which the Purchasing Agent had prior possession, promptly on the Purchasing Agent so</li>
<li>becoming aware;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(iii) is requested or legally compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil or criminal investigative demand, or similar processes), or is required by a regulatory body, to be disclosed. However, the Purchasing Agent shall:
<ul>
<li>A. provide the Company with prompt notice of these requests or requirements before making a disclosure so that the Company</li>
<li>may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy; and</li>
<li>B. provide reasonable assistance to the Company in obtaining any protective order.</li>
<li>If a protective order or other remedy is not obtained or the Company grants a waiver under this agreement, the Purchasing</li>
<li>Agent may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that, in the written opinion of counsel</li>
<li>reasonably acceptable to the Company, the Purchasing Agent is legally compelled or otherwise required to disclose. However,</li>
<li>the Purchasing Agent shall make reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded</li>
<li>any part of the Confidential Information disclosed in this way; or</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(iv) was developed by the Purchasing Agent independently without breach of this agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(c) <strong>Remedy.</strong> Money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this section by the Purchasing Agent and, in addition to all other remedies, the Company may seek (and may be entitled to) as a result of such breach, specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>12. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>No Conflicting Representation.</strong> The Purchasing Agent hereby represents to the Company that it does not currently, and during the term of this agreement will not, accept employment from, render services to, represent, or promote any person or entity in connection with any product or service that is competitive with or similar to any product or service of the Company with respect to which the Purchasing Agent is providing any service under this agreement. The Purchasing Agent shall provide the Company with a list of the companies and the products that it currently represents, and notify the Company in writing of any new companies or products when its promotion of those new companies and products starts.</li>
<li>(b) <strong>No Conflicting Purchases.</strong> The Purchasing Agent hereby represents that it has no ownership or financial interest in, and no control of, the manufacturers or suppliers making the Merchandise purchased with the assistance of the Purchasing Agent; that it does not, for its own account, sell raw materials to the manufacturers or suppliers making that Merchandise; and that the manufacturers or suppliers have no ownership or financial interest in, or any control, over the Purchasing Agent. If any interest is consummated, the Purchasing Agent will inform the Company immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>13. RETURN OF PROPERTY; TRANSFER OF INTERESTS</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Return of Property.</strong> Within <field-source type="break" title="How many days after this agreement ends must ''agent_name'' return ''company_name'''s property?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="property_return" label="Days"></field-source> days of the termination of this agreement, the Purchasing Agent shall return to the Company, all property, samples, or models, and all documents, retaining no copies or notes, relating to the Company's business including reports, abstracts, lists, correspondence, information, computer files, computer disks, and all other materials and all copies of that material, obtained by the Purchasing Agent during its work with the Company. All files, records, documents, blueprints, specifications, information, letters, notes, media lists, original artwork or creative work, notebooks, and similar items relating to the Company's business, whether prepared by the Purchasing Agent or by others, remain the Company's exclusive property.</li>
<li>(b) <strong>Transfer of Interests.</strong> After termination of this agreement, the Purchasing Agent shall cooperate in arranging the transfer or approval of third-party interests in all agreements and other arrangements relating to the Company after appropriate release from its obligations in those.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14. INDEMNIFICATION.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Of Purchasing Agent by Company.</strong> At all times after the effective date of this agreement, the Company shall indemnify the Purchasing Agent from all damages, liabilities, expenses, claims, or judgments (including interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees, accounting fees, and expert witness fees) (collectively, the "<strong>Claims</strong>") that the Purchasing Agent may incur and that arise from:
<ul>
<li>(i) the Company's breach of its obligations or representations under this agreement;</li>
<li>(ii) the negligent, intentional, or other acts of the Company or its employees; or</li>
<li>(iii) the Company's failure to pay the purchase price of any Merchandise, or any sales or use taxes imposed on that Merchandise, or the cost of shipping and handling any Merchandise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, the Company is not obligated to indemnify the Purchasing Agent if any of these Claims result from the Purchasing Agent's own actions or inactions.</li>
<li>(b) <strong>Of Company by Purchasing Agent.</strong> At all times after the effective date of this agreement, the Purchasing Agent shall indemnify the Company and its officers, members, managers, employees, owners, and contractors (collectively, the "<strong>Company Indemnitees</strong>") from all damages, liabilities, expenses, claims, or judgments (including interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees, accounting fees, and expert witness fees) (collectively, the "<strong>Claims</strong>") that any Company Indemnitee may incur and that arise from:
<ul>
<li>(i) the Purchasing Agent's negligence or willful misconduct arising from the Purchasing Agent's carrying out of its obligations under this agreement;</li>
<li>(ii) the Purchasing Agent's breach of any of its obligations or representations under this agreement; or</li>
<li>(iii) the Purchasing Agent's breach of its express representation that it is an independent contractor and in compliance with all applicable laws related to work as an independent contractor. If a regulatory body or court of competent jurisdiction finds that the Purchasing Agent is not an independent contractor or is not in compliance with applicable laws related to work as an independent contractor, based on the Purchasing Agent's own actions, the Purchasing Agent will assume full responsibility and liability for all taxes, assessments, and penalties imposed against the Purchasing Agent or the Company resulting from that contrary interpretation, including taxes, assessments, and penalties that would have been deducted from the Purchasing Agent's earnings if the Purchasing Agent had been on the Company's payroll and employed as a Company employee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>15. FORCE MAJEURE.</strong></p>
<p>A party will not be considered in breach or in default because of, and will not be liable to the other party for, any delay or failure to perform its obligations under this agreement by reason of fire, earthquake, flood, explosion, strike, riot, war, terrorism, or similar event beyond that party's reasonable control (each a "<strong>Force Majeure Event</strong>"). However, if a Force Majeure Event occurs, the affected party shall, as soon as practicable:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) notify the other party of the Force Majeure Event and its impact on performance under this agreement; and</li>
<li>(b) use reasonable efforts to resolve any issues resulting from the Force Majeure Event and perform its obligations under this agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>16. GOVERNING LAW.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Choice of Law.</strong> The laws of the state of <field-source type="break" title="Which state's laws will interpret this agreement if there's a dispute?" label="This is usually a state where one or both parties live or do business."></field-source><field-source type="state" fid="state_law" label="N/A"></field-source> govern this agreement (without giving effect to its conflicts of law principles).</li>
<li>(b) <strong>Choice of Forum.</strong> Both parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in <field-source type="break" title="What county and state would handle any potential lawsuit?" label="Like the question before, this should be a state the parties have some connection to."></field-source><field-source type="text" fid="county_lawsuit" label="County"></field-source> County, <field-source type="state" fid="state_lawsuit" label="N/A"></field-source>.</li>

These signatures must be treated in all respects as having the same force and effect as original signatures.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>20. SEVERABILITY.</strong></p>
<p>If any provision contained in this agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, that invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other provisions of this agreement, but this agreement will be construed as if the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provisions had never been contained in it, unless the deletion of those provisions would result in such a material change so as to cause completion of the transactions contemplated by this agreement to be unreasonable.</p>
<p><strong>21. NOTICES.</strong></p>
