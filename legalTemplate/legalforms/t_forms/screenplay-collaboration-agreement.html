<p>This screenplay collaboration agreement is between&nbsp;<field-source type="textcaps" fid="person1_first" label="First name"></field-source> <field-source type="textcaps" fid="person1_last" label="Last name"></field-source>, an individual ("<strong><field-source type="prefill" fid="person1_last" label="N/A"></field-source></strong>") and&nbsp;<field-source type="break" title="What's the second person's name?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="textcaps" fid="person2_first" label="First name"></field-source> <field-source type="textcaps" fid="person2_last" label="Last name"></field-source>, an individual ("<strong><field-source type="prefill" fid="person2_last" label="N/A"></field-source></strong>").</p>
<p>The parties are writers who wish to collaborate in the writing of a screenplay (the "<strong>Joint Work</strong>"), which has the working title <field-source type="break" title="Now, what's the screenplay's working title?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="text" fid="screen_title" label="Name"></field-source>.</p>
<p>The parties intend that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole.</p>
<p>The parties therefore agree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1. COLLABORATION ON WORK.</strong></p>
<p>The parties shall collaborate in the writing of the Joint Work in accordance with this agreement, which applies only to the Joint Work.</p>
<p><strong>2. REGISTRATION.</strong></p>
<p>The parties shall register the Joint Work for copyright in the name of both parties, and each party designates the other as his or her attorney-in-fact to register the Joint Work with the United States Copyright Office. After the Joint Work is complete, the parties shall also register the Joint Work with the Writers Guild of America, <field-source type="break" title="Where will you register the screenplay?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="radio" fid="reg_location" label="N/A" options="Writer's Guild West,Writer's Guild East"></field-source><section-dep secid="reg_location" secval="writer's guild west">West</section-dep><section-dep secid="reg_location" secval="writer's guild east">East</section-dep>, Inc. as a joint work of the parties. The parties shall be listed as coauthors and copyright claimants of the Joint Work. If the Joint Work is published, the authorship credits shall be given as follows: <field-source type="break" title="If your screenplay's published, will ''person1_first'' be listed first in the byline?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="radio" fid="credit_order" label="N/A" options="Yes,No"></field-source><field-source type="prefill" fid="person1_first" label="N/A" q="N/A" dep="credit_order=yes"></field-source><field-source type="prefill" fid="person2_first" label="N/A" q="N/A" dep="credit_order=no"></field-source> <field-source type="prefill" fid="person1_last" label="N/A" q="N/A" dep="credit_order=yes"></field-source><field-source type="prefill" fid="person2_last" label="N/A" q="N/A" dep="credit_order=no"></field-source> and <field-source type="prefill" fid="person2_first" label="N/A" q="N/A" dep="credit_order=yes"></field-source><field-source type="prefill" fid="person1_first" label="N/A" q="N/A" dep="credit_order=no"></field-source> <field-source type="prefill" fid="person2_last" label="N/A" q="N/A" dep="credit_order=yes"></field-source><field-source type="prefill" fid="person1_last" label="N/A" q="N/A" dep="credit_order=no"></field-source>.</p>
<p><strong>3. OWNERSHIP OF JOINT WORK.</strong></p>
<p>When the Joint Work has been completed, the parties shall own interests (each an "<strong>Interest</strong>") in the Joint Work in the following percentages:</p>
<p><field-source type="prefill" fid="person1_first" label="N/A"></field-source> <field-source type="prefill" fid="person1_last" label="N/A"></field-source>: <field-source type="break" title="Great. Now, what percentage of the screenplay does each person own?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="text" fid="person1_percent" label="Person 1 percentage"></field-source>%</p>
<p><field-source type="prefill" fid="person2_first" label="N/A"></field-source> <field-source type="prefill" fid="person2_last" label="N/A"></field-source>: <field-source type="text" fid="person2_percent" label="Person 2 percentage"></field-source>%</p>
<p>Neither party may sell or dispose of the Joint Work or of his or her Interests without the prior written consent of the other party.<field-source type="break" title="Do you want to set a target date for finishing the screenplay?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="radio" fid="finish_date" label="N/A" options="Yes,No"></field-source></p>
<p><section-dep secid="finish_date" secval="yes"><strong>4. COMPLETION DATE.</strong></section-dep></p>
<p><section-dep secid="finish_date" secval="yes">The parties anticipate that the Joint Work will be completed no later than <field-source type="datepicker" fid="date_of_finish" label="N/A" q="Ok, what date?" dep="finish_date=yes"></field-source>. The parties' failure to complete the Joint Work by this date will not be construed as a breach of this agreement.</section-dep></p>
<p><strong>5. DISTRIBUTIONS.</strong></p>
<p>The parties shall distribute any money or other consideration derived from the sale or disposition of the Joint Work as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) to pay commissions, if any;</li>
<li>(b) to pay or reimburse either party's expenses made in connection with the Joint Work; and</li>
<li>(c) to the parties in proportion to their Interests. The parties shall share proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the Joint Work, including the sale of motion picture, sequel, prequel, remake, television film, television live, stage, radio, and book and other media publication rights, in proportion to their Interests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. WITHDRAWAL FROM COLLABORATION.</strong></p>
<p>If a party withdraws from collaboration before the Joint Work is completed, he or she must give written notice of that withdrawal to the other party. If one party withdraws, the other party may complete the Joint Work, either alone or with another collaborator, and each party's Interest shall, if requested by either party, be revised by written amendment. The other party's continuation of the Joint Work may occur only with the consent of the party legally owning or controlling any preexisting material or work on which the Joint Work is based.</p>
<p><strong>7. REPRESENTATIONS.</strong></p>
<p>Each party hereby represents to the other that:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) he or she is the sole owner of all interest in his or her contribution to the Joint Work.</li>
<li>(b) his or her contribution to the Joint Work is original, not in the public domain, not plagiarized, and does not contain anything libelous or obscene;</li>
<li>(c) his or her contribution to the Joint Work has not been assigned, transferred, licensed, pledged, or otherwise encumbered and he or she has not agreed to do so;</li>
<li>(d) he or she is not aware of any violation, infringement, or misappropriation of any third party's rights or any claims of rights (including existing intellectual property rights, rights of privacy, or any other rights) regarding his or her contribution to the Joint Work.</li>
<li>(e) he or she is not aware of any third-party consents, assignments, or licenses that are necessary to perform under this agreement; and</li>
<li>(f) he or she is not acting within the scope of employment of any third party when conceiving, creating, or otherwise performing any activity with respect to his or her contribution to the Joint Work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each party shall keep the other party informed of matters requiring mutual decision about the Joint Work. Each party shall respond to communications from the other party regarding the Joint Work, and from others having an interest in the Joint Work, in a reasonable and timely manner to prevent harm to or unreasonable delay of the creation, sale, or other disposition of the Joint Work.</p>
<p><strong>8. AGENT.</strong></p>
<p><field-source type="break" title="What's your agent's name?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="text" fid="agent_name" label="Name"></field-source> shall be the parties' sole and exclusive agent in connection with the Joint Work or any rights in the Joint Work, until that agent is terminated by (or stops representing) the parties. All payments due or to become due to the parties in connection with the sale, lease, or license of the Joint Work shall be made to and in the name of this agent, who is authorized to receive these amounts on the parties' behalf. That agent shall receive gross commissions on all licenses of <field-source type="break" title="And what percent commission does the agent take?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="text" fid="agent_com" label="Commission"></field-source>%. If the parties do not have an agent or other representation, those payments shall be made directly to the parties in accordance with their Interests.</p>
<p><strong>9. VALUE.</strong></p>
<p>The monetary value of the Joint Work may be fixed only by the mutual written consent of the parties.</p>
<p><strong>10. EXPENSES.</strong></p>
<p>All expenses for which the parties are mutually responsible may be incurred only with the prior written consent of both parties. If a party, without the consent of the other party, incurs an expense in order to advance the production or promotion of the Joint Work, the party making the expenditure cannot later require full or partial compensation for such expense from the other party.</p>
<p><strong>11. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with section 3, the parties shall own jointly all copyright or other intellectual property rights in all incidents, plots, dialogue, characters, action, and titles forming a part of the Joint Work.
