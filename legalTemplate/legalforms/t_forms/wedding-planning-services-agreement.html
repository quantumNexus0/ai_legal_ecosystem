<li><strong>(a) Of Couple by Wedding Planner.</strong> At all times after the effective date of this agreement, the Wedding Planner shall indemnify the Couple from all damages, liabilities, expenses, claims, or judgments (including interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees, accounting fees, and expert witness fees) (collectively, the "<strong>Claims</strong>") that the Couple may incur and that arise from:
<ul>
<li><strong>(i)</strong> the Wedding Planner's negligence or willful misconduct arising from the Wedding Planner's carrying out of its obligations under this agreement;</li>
<li><strong>(ii)</strong> the Wedding Planner's breach of any of its obligations or representations under this agreement; or</li>
<li><strong>(iii)</strong> the Wedding Planner's breach of its express representation that it is an independent contractor and in compliance with all applicable laws related to work as an independent contractor. If a regulatory body or court of competent jurisdiction finds that the Wedding Planner is not an independent contractor or is not in compliance with applicable laws related to work as an independent contractor, based on the Wedding Planner's own actions, the Wedding Planner will assume full responsibility and liability for all taxes, assessments, and penalties imposed against the Wedding Planner or the Couple resulting from that contrary interpretation, including taxes, assessments, and penalties that would have been deducted from the Wedding Planner's earnings if the Wedding Planner had been on the Couple's payroll and employed as an employee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>(b) Of Wedding Planner by Couple.</strong> At all times after the effective date of this agreement, the Couple shall indemnify the Wedding Planner and its officers, members, managers, employees, agents, contractors, sublicensees, affiliates, subsidiaries, successors, and assigns (collectively, the "<strong>Wedding Planner Indemnitees</strong>") from all Claims that the Wedding Planner Indemnitees may incur arising from:

<li><strong>(ii)</strong> the Couple's nonpayment of other Wedding vendors or the actions of the Couple or their invitees to the Wedding during the Wedding.

<li><strong>(c) Exclusions.</strong> The Wedding Planner is not responsible for damages or other costs occurring because of inclement weather. Any weather that prohibits any part of the Wedding from occurring does not constitute a breach of the Wedding Planner's obligations under this agreement. The Wedding Planner shall use its best efforts to limit the impact of inclement weather on the quality of its Services, but may make last minute changes to ensure the overall performance of the Wedding Planner's team and other vendors that have been retained.</li>
