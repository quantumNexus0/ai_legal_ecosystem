<p>The Host is engaged in the business of providing hosting and related services.</p>
<p>The User wants to retain the Host to perform the services provided for in this agreement.</p>
<p>The parties therefore agree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1. ENGAGEMENT; SERVICES.</strong></p>
<p>The Host shall provide the services set forth in <strong>Exhibit A</strong> (the "<strong>Services</strong>"), as described in <strong>Exhibit B</strong> ("<strong>Service Level Agreement</strong>").</p>
<p><strong>2. PRICE; PAYMENT.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Price.</strong> The User shall pay the Host for the Services according to the terms set forth in <strong>Exhibit A</strong>.</li>
<li>(b) <strong>Invoices.</strong> The Host shall send an invoice every month in amounts equal to the fees listed in <strong>Exhibit A</strong>. Within 30 days of its receipt, the User shall pay each accurate and undisputed invoice.</li>
<li>(c) <strong>Disputes.</strong> If the User disputes a particular invoice, the User shall pay the Host for the parts of the invoice that are accurate and not in dispute.</li>
<li>(d) <strong>Price Changes.</strong> The Host may change prices annually after the Initial Term (as defined below) expires. However, increases in fees during a Renewal Term (as defined below) are limited to a <field-source type="break" title="What's the maximum percent that service fees can be raised each year?" label="This should be between 1-20 percent."></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="max_service_raise" label="Percent"></field-source>% increase over the rates during the immediately preceding Term.&nbsp; The Host shall provide the User with at least&nbsp;<field-source type="break" title="How many days' notice must the host give if they plan to raise fees?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="raise_fees_notice" label="Days"></field-source> days' notice before the price change will take effect (the "<strong>Price Change Notice Period</strong>").&nbsp; If the User rejects the price change in writing during the Price Change Notice Period, this agreement will automatically terminate at the end of the term in which the Price Change Notice Period expires.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Host cannot provide the availability level indicated in the Service Level Agreement, and the User complies with its credit request procedures, the User shall receive a credit based upon the credit percentages in <strong>Exhibit B</strong>. The Host shall include any credit due under that agreement on the next invoice.</p>
<p><strong>3. TERM; TERMINATION.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Term.</strong> This agreement will become effective as described in section 21 and continue for an initial term of <field-source type="break" title="How long is the initial agreement?" label="This should be from 1-5 years, please enter the number only."></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="initial_term" label="Years"></field-source> year(s) (the "<strong>Initial Term</strong>"). Unless either party gives written notice to the other at least <field-source type="break" title="How many days' notice is required to terminate the agreement?" label="This should be 30, 45, or 60 days."></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="notice_days" label="Days"></field-source> days before the end of the Term, this agreement will renew automatically for an additional <field-source type="break" title="If this agreement isn't terminated, how many years will it automatically renew for?" label="This should be from 1-5 years, please enter the number only."></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="auto_renew_years" label="Years"></field-source>-year term (each a "<strong>Renewal Term</strong>"). This automatic extension will continue to apply at the end of each Renewal Term until the agreement is terminated.</li>
<li>(b) <strong>Termination Procedures.</strong> This agreement may be terminated:
<ul>
<li>(i) by either party, on provision of&nbsp;<field-source type="prefill" fid="notice_days" label="N/A"></field-source> days' written notice before the end of a Term;</li>
<li>(ii) by either party for a material breach of any provision of this agreement by the other party, if the other party's material breach is not cured within 30 days of receipt of written notice;</li>
<li>(iii) by the User, immediately on written notice to the Host, if there is less than <field-source type="break" title="Now, what's the minimum percentage of uptime per week required to keep the agreement effective?" label="Uptime refers to when the host's servers are functioning normally. This should be between 90-100 percent of the time."></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="min_percent" label="Percent"></field-source>% uptime in any Services during any one-week period during any term (excluding scheduled maintenance); or</li>
<li>(iv) by the User, immediately on written notice to the Host, if there is a breach of the Host's security systems that results in the actual or potential unauthorized disclosure of the User's Content (as defined below.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(c) <strong>Effects of Termination.</strong> After the termination of this agreement for any reason:
<ul>
<li>(i) the Host shall export and return any content then in its possession to the User at the User's expense, and the Host shall delete that content from the Host's servers and data storage devices, unless the User notifies the host in writing no more than 30 days after the termination of this agreement, of its desire to maintain the content on the Host's equipment. If the Host maintains this content, the Host shall make the content reasonably available to the User and the User shall pay the Host's customary rates for these services and reimburse Host for the cost of making the content available; and</li>
<li>(ii) the User shall promptly pay the Host according to the terms of <strong>Exhibit A</strong> for Services rendered before the effective date of the termination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. CUSTOMER SERVICE.</strong></p>
<p>The Host shall consult with the User via telephone or electronic mail about how to use of the system on the terms set forth in the Service Level Agreement, but will not assist with any services not maintained or controlled by the Host as part of this Agreement. Third-party applications, mail-enabled printers/scanners, web services, and custom transport rules may be supported but will be scoped and billed separately.</p>
<p><strong>5. SECURITY; BACK-UP.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Security.</strong> The Host shall locate all content on secure servers with limited access and required access authentication. The Host shall handle all content in accordance with industry best practices and the terms of this agreement.</li>
<li>(b) <strong>Back-Up.</strong> If the User requests, the Host shall restore content to the User using the Host's data back-ups. The Host shall maintain a copy of the past&nbsp;<field-source type="break" title="How many days' worth of content does the host have to maintain a backup of?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="backup_days" label="Days"></field-source> days of all content. The Host shall provide the User with the ability to self-restore any deleted mail item within the past&nbsp;<field-source type="break" title="How many days must the host give the user to restore deleted emails?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="email_restoration" label="Days"></field-source> days. The Host may provide backup support and data restoration beyond the above referenced period for a data recovery fee as outlined in <strong>Exhibit A</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. CONTENT.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Content.</strong> The User represents that it is the owner or valid licensee of all data or content it will upload in connection with the Services (collectively, the "<strong>Content</strong>") and that it has secured all necessary licenses, consents, permissions, waivers, and releases for the use of the Content.</li>
<li>(b) The Host may use the intellectual property of the User to do the following, to the extent necessary to perform the Services:
<ul>
<li>(i) digitize, convert, install, upload, select, order, arrange, compile and synchronize, use, reproduce, store, process, retrieve, transmit, and hyperlink the Content; and</li>
<li>(ii) make archival or back-up copies of the Content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.</strong></p>

<li>(c) Emergency maintenance does not count as downtime and is not included in the uptime guarantee calculations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>8. HARDWARE REPLACEMENT.</strong></p>
<p>The Host may replace hardware for any reason, at any time.</p>
<p><strong>9. DOWNTIME EXCLUSIONS.</strong></p>
<p>The unavailability of Host services due to the following will not be considered to be downtime (and credits will not be issued) ("<strong>Excusable Downtime</strong>"):</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) The User's applications and content, and errors from the User's own custom scripting or coding;</li>
<li>(b) The User's configuration(s) outside of the Host infrastructure that affects Host services;</li>
<li>(c) The User's acts or omissions;</li>
<li>(d) Force majeure;</li>
<li>(e) Services provided by a third party outside of the Host's control;</li>
<li>(f) Maintenance during the Normal Maintenance Window or emergency maintenance (as described in section 7);</li>
<li>(g) Downtime to install services User requests;</li>
<li>(h) Internet traffic exchange points external to Host, including without limitation Network Access Points ("<strong>NAPs</strong>") and Metropolitan Area Exchanges ("<strong>MAEs</strong>"), and Internet networks controlled by others; or</li>
<li>(i) Suspension of services (for example, if the User doesn't pay the Host).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>10. CREDIT REQUEST AND LIMITATIONS.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) To receive a credit, the User must open a trouble ticket for the problem, and contact a Host Service Representative via <field-source type="break" title="Where should the user email requests for server charge credits?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="text" fid="server_charge_credits_email" label="Email"></field-source> within <field-source type="break" title="And within how many days of server failure or outage must the user request credit?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="server_failure_credit_redemption" label="Days"></field-source> days of the outage or failure and request a credit.</li>
<li>(b) Multiple credits will not be paid for different types of outages occurring at the same time (no overlapping credits). There are no duplicate credits for the same outage, and the greater of the applicable credits will apply.</li>
<li>(c) There is an overall cap on credits in a month.&nbsp; Credit in a month for a service cannot be more than 100% of the charges for the service for a month.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>11. TROUBLE TICKETS.</strong></p>
<p>A member of the Host's Network Operations Center Service Desk staff will be available to assist you with problems and questions regarding the hosting services. The Host will supply telephone or email support to you regarding the hosting services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If problem is determined to be non-hosting environment related a charge may be incurred at an hourly rate of <field-source type="break" title="What's the host's hourly charge to fix problems in a non-hosting environment?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="currency" fid="non_hosting_hourly_work_charge" label="Hourly fee"></field-source>.</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) User may open a trouble ticket using one of the following methods:&nbsp;<field-source type="break" title="How can the user open a ticket if there's an issue?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="checkbox" fid="ticket1" label="N/A" options="Phone"></field-source><field-source type="checkbox" fid="ticket2" label="N/A" options="Email"></field-source><field-source type="checkbox" fid="ticket3" label="N/A" options="Text"></field-source>

</ul>
<p><strong>12. HOST WILL ONLY PAY CREDITS FOR DOWNTIME OR OUTAGES.</strong></p>
<p>The Host is not liable for any damages the User claims to have suffered because of Host downtime or outages, including the unavailability of software, operating systems, applications, and data.</p>
<p><strong>13. INTERNET BANDWIDTH.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Metered Bandwidth.</strong>
<ul>
<li>(i) The User is charged based on the cumulative bandwidth usage each month.</li>
<li>(ii) If bandwidth consumption is greater than the purchased amount, an overage charge is billed to the User.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(b) <strong>Internet Bandwidth Measurement</strong>
<ul>
<li>(i) Internet bandwidth is measured by taking samples of usage periodically minutes during a calendar month and collecting a fixed number of readings (cumulative of inbound feeds and cumulative of outbound feeds at the same measured point in time). The timing and number of readings will be set forth on an attached exhibit to this agreement.</li>
<li>(ii) The measurements are stored and become data points.&nbsp; At the end of the month, all data points taken during the month are ranked in ascending order.</li>
<li>(iii) The Host will discard a fixed percentage for each set (inbound and outbound) of data points.&nbsp; The percentage will be set forth on an attached exhibit to this agreement</li>
<li>(iv) The highest remaining sample of t sets becomes the User's sustained (base) or burstable usage number for that billing cycle.</li>
<li>(v) The User will be invoiced at the end of each month for burstable internet bandwidth usage, if any.</li>
</ul>
</li>
