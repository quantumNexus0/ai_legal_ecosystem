<p><strong>1. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.</strong></p>
<p>In conjunction with the Employee's employment, the Company may (but is not required to) disclose to the Employee, or the Employee may develop or learn, Confidential Information. <strong>"Confidential Information"</strong> means:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) any Company intellectual property, information, or trade secrets (whether or not specifically labeled or identified as confidential), whether provided orally, in writing, or by any other media, that was or will be disclosed to, developed, or learned by the Employee, and that relates to the business, products, services, research, or development of or by the Company or its suppliers, distributors, investors, partners, and other business associates, and that has not become publicly known. Confidential Information includes:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(i) internal business information (including information relating to strategy, staffing, business, financial data, training, marketing, promotional and sales plans and practices, costs, bidding activities and strategies, rate and pricing structures, and accounting and business methods);</li>
<li>(ii) identities of, negotiations with, individual requirements of, specific contractual arrangements with, and information about the Company's suppliers, distributors, customers, investors, partners, and other business associates, their contact information, and their confidential information;</li>
<li>(iii) manufacturing parameters, material specifications, design specifications, design processes, technical drawings, prototypes, testing procedures and technical data, specific program information, trade or industrial practices, engineering practices and methods, techniques, computer programs, formulae, systems, research, records, reports, manuals, documentation, customer and supply lists, data and databases relating to those, and technology and methodology regarding specific projects; and</li>
<li>(iv) inventions, whether or not patentable, original works of authorship, trade secrets, know how, other intangible property protectable under federal, state, or foreign law that is not generally available to the public or published by the Company, other information concerning the Company's or its customers' actual or anticipated products or services, business, research, or development, or any information that is received in confidence by or for the Company from any other person, and any other information that was or will be developed, created, or discovered by or on behalf of the Company, or that became or will become known by, or was or is conveyed to the Company, that has commercial value in the Company's business (<strong>"Intellectual Property"</strong>); and</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(b) all notes, analyses, compilations, studies, summaries, and other material, whether provided orally, in writing, or by any other media, that contain or are based on all or part of the information described in subsection (a) (the <strong>"Derivative Materials"</strong>).</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. OBLIGATION TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> At all times during his or her employment, the Employee shall hold in strictest confidence, and not use, except for the benefit of the Company, or to disclose to any person, firm, or corporation without the prior written authorization of the Company, any of the Company's Confidential Information.</li>
<li></li>
<li>(b) <strong>Term.</strong> The Employee shall maintain the confidentiality and security of the Confidential Information until the earlier of: (i) such time as all Confidential Information disclosed under this agreement becomes publicly known and is made generally available through no action or inaction of the Employee or (ii) the third anniversary of the termination of the Employee's employment. However, to the extent that the Company has disclosed information to the Employee that constitutes a trade secret under law, the Employee shall protect that trade secret for as long as the information qualifies as a trade secret.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. EXCLUSIONS.</strong></p>
<p>The obligations and restrictions of this agreement do not apply to that part of the Confidential Information that:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) was or becomes available other than as a result of a disclosure by the Employee in violation of this agreement;</li>
<li></li>
<li>(b) was or becomes available to the Employee on a nonconfidential basis before its disclosure to the Employee by the Company or a Company Representative, but only if:
<ul>
<li>(i) the source of such information is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company or is not otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to the Employee by a contractual, legal, fiduciary, or other obligation; and</li>
<li>(ii) the Employee provides the Company with written notice of such prior possession either (A) before the execution and delivery of this agreement or (B) if the Employee later becomes aware (through disclosure to the Employee) of any aspect of the Confidential Information as to which the Employee had prior possession, promptly on the Employee so becoming aware; or</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(c) is requested or legally compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil or criminal investigative demand, or similar process), or is required by a regulatory body, to be disclosed. However, the Employee shall:
<ul>
<li>(i) provide the Company with prompt notice of any such request or requirement before disclosure so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy; and</li>
<li>(ii) provide reasonable assistance to the Company in obtaining any such protective order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a protective order or other remedy is not obtained or the Company grants a waiver under this agreement, then the Employee may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that, in the written opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company, the Employee is legally compelled or otherwise required to disclose. The Employee shall make reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any part of the Confidential Information so disclosed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. INVENTIONS.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>Inventions Retained and Licensed.</strong>&nbsp;Attached as <strong>Exhibit A</strong> to this agreement is a list of all Intellectual Property that the Employee made before his or her employment with the Company (the <strong>"Prior Inventions"</strong>) that belong to the Employee, that relate to the Company's proposed business, products, or research and development, and that are not assigned to the Company under this agreement. If no such list is attached, the Employee represents that there are no Prior Inventions. If disclosure of any such Prior Invention would cause the Employee to violate a prior confidentiality agreement, the Employee will not list the Prior Invention in <strong>Exhibit A</strong> but will provide a name of the invention, a list of the party or parties it belongs to, and the explanation why full disclosure was not given. A space is provided in <strong>Exhibit A</strong> for this purpose. If in the course of employment with the Company, the Employee incorporates into a Company product, process, or machine a Prior Invention owned by the Employee or in which the Employee has an interest, the Company will be granted and have a nonexclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide license to make, have made, modify, use, and sell such Prior Invention as part of or in connection with such product, process, or machine.</li>
<li></li>
<li>(b) <strong>Assignment of Intellectual Property and Inventions.</strong> The Employee shall disclose promptly in writing to the Company all Intellectual Property that the Employee has authored, made, conceived, or first actually reduced to practice, alone or jointly with others:
<ul>
<li>(i) while the Employee is or was performing duties for the Company;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(ii) during the Employee's employment with the Company, if it relates to the Company's areas of business or investigations;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(iii) that results from or is suggested by any work that the Employee does for the Company or at the Company's request; or</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>(iv) that was aided by the Employee's use of the Company's equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information, whether or not during working hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>This Employee-created Intellectual Property is referred to in this agreement as <strong>"Inventions."</strong></li>
<li>The Employee acknowledges that any Invention the Employee makes within the scope of and during his or her employment with the Company and that is protectable by copyright is a "work made for hire," as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act.</li>
<li>In addition, all Intellectual Property and all title, patents, patent rights, copyrights, trade secret rights, and other intellectual property and rights anywhere in the world (collectively, the <strong>"Rights"</strong>) connected to those will be the sole property of the Company.
