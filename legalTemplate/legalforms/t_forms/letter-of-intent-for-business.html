<p>Our proposal is as follows: <field-source type="break" title="Now, we need to know who's responsible for what." label="Please provide enough details so it's clear what actions each party will take."></field-source></p>
<p><strong>1. PROPOSED TRANSACTION.</strong></p>
<p><field-source type="prefill" fid="letter_of_intent_sender_name" label="N/A"></field-source> will do each of the following: <field-source type="textarea" fid="sender_obligations" label="Description" q="Please describe ''letter_of_intent_sender_name'''s obligations."></field-source>.<br>

<p><br data-tomark-pass=""><br>
<strong>2. TIMING.</strong></p>
<p><field-source type="break" title="Let's talk about timing. By what date should the deal be executed? " label="This is the &quot;closing date,&quot; the date by which a final agreement must be signed."></field-source>The parties shall execute the Final Agreements and close the Proposed Transaction by <field-source type="datepicker" fid="letter_of_intent_execution_date" label="N/A"></field-source> (the "<strong>Closing Date</strong>"), subject to the extension discussed in section <section-link num="6"></section-link> below.<field-source type="break" title="When must each party complete their due diligence by?" label="These are the things that must happen before both parties are obligated to complete the deal. To clarify, due diligence is just research for any information that may be relevant to the deal. For example, if the transaction is a sale of assets, the buyer may want to review the seller's records about the assets."></field-source></p>
<p><strong>3. CONTINGENCIES.</strong></p>
<p>Any obligation to consummate the Proposed Transaction under the terms of this letter is based entirely on satisfaction of each of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) receipt of all applicable consents, approvals, and authorizations including board, partnership, third-party, and regulatory approvals, if any, relating to the Proposed Transaction; and</li>
<li>(b) completion by each party and its business, legal, financial, and engineering representatives of a substantial due diligence investigation of all relevant business, legal, financial, engineering, and environmental documents, with results satisfactory to that party, no later than <field-source type="datepicker" fid="due_dil_date" label="N/A"></field-source> (the "<strong>Due Diligence Completion Date</strong>").</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. DUE DILIGENCE.</strong></p>
<p>While this letter remains in effect, each party and its advisors shall have reasonable access to the other party's books, records, and personnel files, and shall receive such financial and operational data and other information as that party may reasonably request. Any received information will be kept confidential by the receiving party. On termination or expiration of this letter, each party shall return all printed information received from the other party in connection with the Proposed Transaction.</p>
<p><strong>5. NOTICE AFTER COMPLETION OF DUE DILIGENCE.</strong></p>
<p>On or before the Due Diligence Completion Date, each party shall notify the other party in writing that it has completed substantial due diligence and is prepared to proceed with consummation of the Proposed Transaction (the "<strong>Notice of Intention to Proceed</strong>"). If a party does not provide a Notice of Intention to Proceed to the other party on or before the Due Diligence Completion Date, the other party may cancel this proposal and neither party will have any obligation or liability to the other party. The effective date of receipt of a Notice of Intention to Proceed is its date of receipt as acknowledged in writing by the receiving party.</p>
<p><strong>6. EXTENSION OF TIME FOR CLOSING.</strong></p>
<p>If the Proposed Transaction is not completed by the Closing Date and each party has been operating in good faith to complete its due diligence and negotiate the transaction documents to consummate the Proposed Transaction, the parties shall evaluate the progress made towards closing and, if suitable progress is being made, discuss in good faith a revised Counting Period (as defined below) and Closing Date. If the parties have not made satisfactory progress towards closing, either party may withdraw from the Proposed Transaction without any further obligation or liability to the other party. A party withdrawing from the Proposed Transaction under the preceding sentence shall promptly inform the other party in writing of this withdrawal. The term "<strong>Counting Period</strong>" means the period from the date of this letter until the Closing Date, if on or before the Due Diligence Completion Date each party has sent the Notice of Intention to Proceed in accordance with the terms of section <section-link num="5"></section-link> above.</p>
<p><strong>7. FINAL AGREEMENTS.</strong></p>
<p>The Final Agreements may include customary covenants, conditions, representations, and warranties. As this is a nonbinding letter, there may be additional elements for negotiation and inclusion.<field-source type="break" title="Can the parties talk publicly about their deal before the closing date?"></field-source><field-source type="radio" fid="letter_of_intent_public_disclosure" label="N/A" options="Yes,No"></field-source></p>
<p><section-dep secid="letter_of_intent_public_disclosure" secval="no"><strong>8. NO PUBLIC DISCLOSURES.</strong></section-dep></p>
<p><section-dep secid="letter_of_intent_public_disclosure" secval="no">Except as required by law, neither party may make a public disclosure about the Proposed Transaction before the Closing Date without the prior written approval of the other party. If the law requires a disclosure, the disclosing party must notify the other party in advance and furnish the other party with a copy of the anticipated disclosure. Any disclosure not required by law that occurs after the Closing Date must be mutually agreeable to the parties. Nothing in this section prevents either party from communicating information about this letter to its respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, or professional advisors or to any third parties whose consent is required in connection with the Proposed Transaction.</section-dep><field-source type="break" title="Do you wish to set an exclusive dealing time period?" label="This basically is a term that allows both parties, for a certain period of time, to be the only players at the negotiating table."></field-source><field-source type="radio" fid="letter_of_intent_exclusive_dealing" label="N/A" options="Yes,No"></field-source></p>
