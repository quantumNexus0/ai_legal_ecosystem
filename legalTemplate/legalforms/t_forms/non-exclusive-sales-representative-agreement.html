<li><section-dep secid="representative_type" secval="individual">(iv) automatically, on the death of the Representative.</section-dep></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>(c) Effect of Termination.</strong> After the termination of this agreement for any reason, the Company shall promptly pay the Representative for Services rendered before the effective date of the termination. However, the Company will not pay the Representative if (i) prohibited under applicable government law, regulation, or policy, or (ii) if the Representative is guilty of serious misconduct in connection with performance under this agreement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. COMPENSATION.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(a) Commissions.</strong> The Representative shall be entitled to receive a commission on sales of the Products in the Territory to customers, which sales were made substantially through the efforts of the Representative during the Term. Commissions shall be payable as follows:
<ul>
<li>(i) <field-source type="break" title="What percentage of the sales amount will ''representative_name'' receive as commission?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="commission" label="Percent"></field-source>% of the Net Amount (as defined below) charged by the Company for orders of the Products placed through the Representative (other than to Existing Customers and their affiliates); and</li>
<li>(ii) <field-source type="break" title="What percentage of the sales amount will ''representative_name'' receive as commission for products not specifically listed in the agreement?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="number" fid="other_commission" label="Percent"></field-source>% of the total Net Amount charged by the Company for orders of products other than Products listed in <strong>Exhibit A</strong> placed through the Representative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"<strong>Net Amount</strong>" means the sales price of the sold Product as listed on the invoice, less charges for handling, freight, sales, use, value added, or similar taxes, import or export taxes or levies taxes, C.O.D. charges, insurance, customs duties, trade discounts, and any other governmental or administrative fees or charges.</li>
<li></li>

<ul>
<li><strong>(a) Confidentiality.</strong> During the Term, the Representative may have access to or receive certain information of or about the Company that the Company designates as confidential or that, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure, ought to be treated as confidential by the Representative ("<strong>Confidential Information</strong>"). Confidential Information includes information relating to the Company or its current or proposed business, financial statements, budgets and projections, customer identifying information, potential and intended customers, employers, products, computer programs, specifications, manuals, software, analyses, strategies, marketing plans, business plans, and other confidential information, provided orally, in writing, by drawings, or by any other media. The Representative will treat the Confidential Information as confidential and will not disclose it to any third party or use it for any purpose but to fulfill its obligations in this agreement. In addition, the Representative shall use due care and diligence to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.</li>
<li></li>
<li><strong>(b) Exceptions.</strong> The obligations and restrictions in subsection (a) do not apply to that part of the Confidential Information:
<ul>
<li>(i) was or becomes publically available other than as a result of a disclosure by the Representative in violation of this agreement;</li>
<li>(ii) was or becomes available to the Representative on a nonconfidential basis before its disclosure to the Representative by the Company, but only if:
<ul>
<li>A. the source of such information is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Company or</li>
<li>is not otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to the Representative by a contractual,</li>
<li>legal, fiduciary, or other obligation; and</li>
<li>B. the Representative provides the Company with written notice of its prior possession either (1)</li>
<li>before the effective date of this agreement or (2) if the Representative later becomes aware (through</li>
<li>disclosure to the Representative) of any aspect of the Confidential Information as to which the</li>
<li>Representative had prior possession, promptly on the Representative so becoming aware;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(iii) is requested or legally compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil or criminal investigative demand, or similar processes), or is required by a regulatory body, to be disclosed. However, the Representative shall:
<ul>
<li>A. provide the Company with prompt notice of these requests or requirements before making a</li>
<li>disclosure so that the Company may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate</li>
<li>remedy; and</li>
<li>B. provide reasonable assistance to the Company in obtaining any protective order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a protective order or other remedy is not obtained or the Company grants a waiver under this agreement, the Representative may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that, in the written opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company, the Representative is legally compelled or otherwise required to disclose. However, the Representative shall make reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded any part of the Confidential Information disclosed in this way; or</li>
<li>(iv) was developed by the Representative independently without breach of this agreement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
<li><strong>(c) Remedy.</strong> Money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this section by the Representative and, in addition to all other remedies, the Company may seek (and may be entitled to) as a result of such breach, specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief as a remedy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>12. CONFLICT OF INTEREST.</strong></p>
<p>The Representative warrants to the Company that it does not currently represent or promote any lines or products that compete with the Products. During the Term, the Representative may not represent, promote, or otherwise try to sell in the Territory any lines or products that, in the Company's judgment, compete with the Products. The Representative shall provide the Company with a list of the companies and the products that it currently represents, and notify the Company in writing of any new companies or products when its promotion of those new companies and products begins.</p>
<p><strong>13. OTHER ACTIVITIES.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>(a) Of Representative by Company.</strong> At all times after the effective date of this agreement, the Company shall indemnify the Representative from all damages, liabilities, expenses, claims, or judgments (including interest, penalties, reasonable attorneys' fees, accounting fees, and expert witness fees) (collectively, the "<strong>Claims</strong>") that the Representative may incur and that arise from:
<ul>
<li>(i) the Company's breach of its obligations or representations under this agreement; or</li>
<li>(ii) the negligent, intentional, or other acts of the Company or its employees;</li>
<li>(iii) defects or malfunctions of the Products; or</li>

<ul>
<li>(i) the Representative's negligence or willful misconduct arising from the Representative's carrying out of its obligations under this agreement;</li>
<li>(ii) the Representative's breach of any of its obligations or representations under this agreement; or</li>
<li>(iii) the Representative's breach of its express representation that it is an independent contractor and in compliance with all applicable laws related to work as an independent contractor. If a regulatory body or court of competent jurisdiction finds that the Representative is not an independent contractor or is not in compliance with applicable laws related to work as an independent contractor, based on the Representative's own actions, the Representative will assume full responsibility and liability for all taxes, assessments, and penalties imposed against the Representative or the Company resulting from that contrary interpretation, including taxes, assessments, and penalties that would have been deducted from the Representative's earnings if the Representative had been on the Company's payroll and employed as a Company employee.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>21. SEVERABILITY.</strong></p>
<p>If any provision contained in this agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect, that invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other provisions of this agreement, but this agreement will be construed as if the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provisions had never been contained in it, unless the deletion of those provisions would result in such a material change so as to cause completion of the transactions contemplated by this agreement to be unreasonable.</p>
