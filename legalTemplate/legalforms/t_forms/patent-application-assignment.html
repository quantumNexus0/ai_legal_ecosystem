<p>The Assignor has invented certain new and useful inventions (the "<strong>Inventions</strong>") and has applied for patents on the Inventions, which are listed on <strong>Exhibit A</strong> (collectively, the "<strong>Applications</strong>").</p>
<p>The Assignor wishes to transfer to the Assignee, and the Assignee wishes to purchase and receive from the Assignor, all of its interest in the Inventions and Applications.</p>
<p>The parties therefore agree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1. ASSIGNMENT OF APPLICATIONS.</strong></p>
<p>Effective as of the Effective Date, the Assignor assigns to the Assignee, and the Assignee assumes from the Assignor, all of the Assignor's interest in the following in the following in the United States and its territories and throughout the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) the Inventions and the Applications listed in <strong>Exhibit A</strong>;</li>
<li>(b) the patent claims, all rights to prepare derivative works, goodwill, and other rights to the Inventions and the Applications;</li>
<li>(c) all registrations, corresponding domestic and foreign applications, letters patents, or similar legal protections issuing on the Inventions and any divisions, continuations, continuations-in-part, and reissues of the Applications, and all rights and benefits under any applicable treaty or convention;</li>
<li>(d) all income, royalties, and damages due or payable to the Assignor with respect to the Inventions and Applications, including damages and payments for past or future infringements of any patent that is issued on the Inventions and Applications; and</li>
<li>(e) all rights to sue for past, present, and future infringements of the Inventions and Applications.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. CONSIDERATION.</strong></p>
<p>The Assignee shall pay the Assignor a flat fee of <field-source type="break" title="Got it. And how much is ''assignee_name'' paying to buy the application(s)?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="currency" fid="flat_fee" label="$ Amount"></field-source> as full payment for all rights granted under this agreement. The Assignee shall complete this payment no later than <field-source type="break" title="By when must ''assignee_name'' make the payment?" label="N/A"></field-source><field-source type="datepicker" fid="payment_date" label="N/A"></field-source>.</p>
<p><strong>3. AUTHORIZATION TO DIRECTOR.</strong></p>
<p>The Assignor hereby authorizes the director of the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office to issue all patents and registrations that may be granted on the Inventions to the Assignee, as the assignee of the entire interest in those, for the Assignee's sole use to the full end of the term for which those patents may be granted, as fully and entirely as they would have been held by the Assignor had this assignment and sale not been made.</p>
<p><strong>4. NO EARLY ASSIGNMENT.</strong></p>
<p>The Assignee may not assign or otherwise encumber its rights in the Inventions, Applications, or associated registrations until it has paid to the Assignor the full consideration provided for in this assignment. Any assignment or encumbrance contrary to this provision shall be void.</p>
<p><strong>5. ASSIGNOR'S REPRESENTATIONS.</strong></p>
<p>The Assignor hereby represents to the Assignee that it:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) is the sole owner of all interest in the Inventions and the Applications;</li>
<li>(b) has not assigned, exclusively licensed, or encumbered any Invention or Application or agreed to do so;</li>
<li>(c)&nbsp; is not aware of any violation or infringement of any third party's rights (or any claim of a violation or infringement) by the Inventions or Applications;</li>
<li>(d) is not aware of any third-party consents, assignments, or licenses that are necessary to perform under this assignment; and</li>
<li>(e) was not acting within the scope of employment of any third party when conceiving, creating, or otherwise performing any activity with respect to the Inventions purportedly assigned in section 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Assignor shall immediately notify the Assignee in writing if any facts or circumstances arise that would make any of the representations in this assignment inaccurate.</p>
<p><strong>6. DOCUMENTATION.</strong></p>
<p>The Assignor will, as soon as is reasonably possible following a request from the Assignee, provide the Assignee with a complete copy of all documentation (in any format) relating to the Inventions and Applications for the Assignee's own use, to meet record-keeping requirements of the Assignee, or to allow the Assignee to assert its rights granted pursuant to this assignment. The Assignor will also, on request and without further consideration:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to the Assignee any additional papers, including any separate assignments of the Inventions or Applications, reasonably necessary to record the assignment in the United States and throughout the world;</li>
<li>(b) generally do all other lawful acts reasonable and necessary to record the assignment in the United States and throughout the world; and</li>
<li>(c) execute all lawful papers that may be required in connection with the filing, prosecution, and maintenance of the Applications or any other patent applications in the United States for the Inventions, including additional documents that may be required to affirm the rights of the Assignee in the Inventions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. NO FURTHER USE OF INVENTIONS.</strong></p>
<p>After the Effective Date, the Assignor shall make no further use of the Inventions or any equivalent, except as authorized by the prior written consent of the Assignee, and the Assignor shall not challenge the Assignee's use or ownership, or the validity, of the Inventions.&nbsp;<field-source type="break" title="Moving right along.
