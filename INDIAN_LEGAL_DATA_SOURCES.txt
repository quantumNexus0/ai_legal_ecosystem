# Free Indian Legal Data Sources for Developers

Here are the best sources to get free Indian legal data (cases, acts, judgments) for your project or API:

## 1. Indian Kanoon (Unofficial API / Scraping)
- **Website**: [https://indiankanoon.org/](https://indiankanoon.org/)
- **Description**: The most comprehensive free database of Indian laws and judgments.
- **Access**: 
    - They have a paid API, but you can use their search URL structure for basic queries.
    - URL structure: `https://indiankanoon.org/search/?formInput=YOUR_QUERY`
    - **Note**: Be respectful of their `robots.txt` and terms of service if scraping.

## 2. National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG)
- **Website**: [https://njdg.ecourts.gov.in/](https://njdg.ecourts.gov.in/)

## 5. OpenNyAI (For NLP models)
- **Website**: [https://github.com/OpenNyAI](https://github.com/OpenNyAI)
- **Description**: Open-source libraries and datasets for Indian Legal NLP.
- **Data**: They provide annotated datasets for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and judgment prediction on Indian cases.

- Example: "Indian Supreme Court Judgments" dataset is often available there.

## Recommended Approach for Your API
If you want to build a reliable API:
1.  **Use OpenNyAI** for training data and NLP models.
2.  **Scrape Indian Kanoon** (responsibly) for real-time search if you cannot afford the paid API.
3.  **Store cached results** in your own database (Supabase/MongoDB) to build your own repository over time.
